1601865753.0|funny|DankMemes148|"Disclaimer: not a medical professional.

They use local anesthesia no matter what to ensure that the patient doesn’t feel pain, but dentist also might use IV sedation for wisdom teeth (drugs that make the patient really loopy and unable to remember most of the removal, but not completely unconscious) to make sure that the patient is comfortable during the removal so that the oral surgeon can do what they need to.  Even if the patient is unable to feel pain while getting their wisdom teeth removed because of local anesthesia, the process of the wisdom teeth being crushed and yanked out will probably still feel pretty uncomfortable, and could terrify the patient.  IV sedation should allow the patient to remain calm through the course of the removal to let the oral surgeon do their work.  Whether or not IV sedation should be used would also probably depend on the severity of the wisdom teeth removal: some people need 2 removed, some all 4, some people’s wisdom teeth are really stuck and need to be yanked out extremely forcefully, others are easier to get out.   

So while IV sedation isn’t required (in most cases at least) and the patient doesn’t have to use it if they absolutely don’t want to, you could see why a lot of oral surgeons would recommend some form of IV sedation to be used along with local anesthesia during the procedure."

He was also mildly cross-eyed, but it has corrected itself since he's been with us.

First off, this is a really old comic and if you don't know it well, you don't know this is typical of Calvin's Dad and is part of the humor of the strip.  It's actually a very fun, funny, hilarious strip about an awesome kid.

Secondly, if you're not well over 40 this won't make as much sense to you, in my opinion.  I'm 48 and (sometimes) I feel guilty for just being outside for no reason.  Take a walk down the road, or in the woods, have a smoke, look around, spend time with just me and myself.  It's awesome but I think a lot of cultures look down on adults for ""doing nothing"".  When actually you're doing one of the best things you can:  relaxing and recharging without sleeping!

But some of us have allowed ourselves to live so long going by societal expectations that you should always be busy ""doing"" something that yes, it's rough at first when you decide that is NOT the way you have to live.  Guilt can be a very hard habit to break."

It should be obvious they aren't part of the truss (if truss attic).

My attic has some loose 2x4s that the contractors have broken off that are now laying on the sheetrock.

Basically, at construction, the lazy builders put 2x4s connecting between the trusses (not at floor level), with many of the ""nails"" meant to hold them in actually not connecting the 2x4 to the truss(es).  So they come off, since they only had a nail barely caught in one place."

They like to put a job they themselves admit should take 2-3 hours into an hour timeslot and shrug when you get behind. Regardless of whatever a corporate moron says, the companies themselves are responsible for fostering the mentality contractors and even in-house technicians have in regards to things like this. “Company doesn’t give a fuck about me, why the fuck should I care how their customers perceive them?”

I say this as somebody who was the guy that would go behind these people and fix the things customers had issue with. It was easy to get upset with the twat I was cleaning up after, but after awhile I couldn’t help but feel sympathetic.

1601861407.0|funny|Radek3887|Idk. If you look over to the left, it looks like there is some plywood laid over the beams. Where he stepped, it looks like it was the end and it may not have been laying on the next beam. So, some thin plywood may have been just hanging in the air on that one end. Kind of like a not fun surprise breaking diving board. I've been in plenty of attics and something like that is worse than not having anything down cause it gives a false sense of security. You could be walking and all of a sudden a board gives way and you have a foot through the ceiling. I've never put my foot through but have had that scare happen many of times.

1601861129.0|funny|iSharingan|"Theres an exploit after the recent design overhaul on mobile. As soon as the ad roll starts, tip your phone up and hit 'back'. When you resume the video, you only get the video-resume single ad and skip the ad roll. Sometimes it takes two tries, but it works in less time than watching all their crappy ads. Previous versions had other tricks, too (using another app/locking your phone for a minute during the first ad, then coming back and letting it finish after the ad roll timer in the background expired, closing the app right as the loading wheel 'skipped' when switching to the ad roll then re-opening the app now that the ad roll bit was marked 'watched', etc. - and the exploits cycled depending on what oversight in the code was active that month). Another exploit right now while watching on 4G signal is repetedly pausing and force-playing with brief pauses while the ad roll is struggling to load. Once the video starts playing smooth (without auto-pausing), you can switch back to wifi and the ad roll won't play.

For PC theres always adblock+/ad-nauseum/etc. - and in all cases theres premium subscription. I'm just not going to waste 3/4 of my break watching ads."

1601861077.0|funny|ThisUsernameIsTook|Had this happen with a plumber working in my attic at my last house. He came through right at the edge of a coved plaster and lathe ceiling. Fortunately for the plaster guy they sent out to fix it, he didn't have to redo the *entire* curved ceiling through the corner. It was still at least a half day job to repair it. I'm pretty sure the plumbing company lost money on that job.
