I would draw the line to only prohibit identity-based criticism that's directed at a specific person.  For example, saying ""Islam is a stupid religion"" should be fine, but not saying ""you're a stupid muslim"".  A particular identity should never be the determining factor.  It should only matter whether or not someone is attacked directly, regardless of what they are attacked for."

You said it was ""when one puts their own race first"". That's not supremacy. Hording power? Okay, maybe. But not caring more about your own race than other people. For example, if you had two buttons in front of you and you were forced to press one, one killed 10 Indians and the other killed 10 white people (or whatever you are), you would obviously press the latter. 

It is not supremacy for *any race* to care more about their own more than others. That's just kinship. Supremacy is thinking you are superior to all in virtually every aspect, which I know white people are not (i.e. eastern Asians have a higher IQ)"

I agree about the tribalism; the problem is that we don't understand quite how human consciousness looks like or what the data we're basing our truths off of comes from.                

It is absolutely supremacy when one group hordes all the power.

I will engage with you but **ONLY** if you think about what you said for at least thirty seconds before you reply again. Because I don't think you are actually that stupid to believe what you said.

1599331285.0|announcements|TheGeorgiaGazette|"I've been addicted to this thread for the last 6 hours straight.   


I own a large news organization in the state of Georgia. We run (ran) 25 Facebook pages, one for each county we cover. We mainly focus on crime, posting mugshots, police reports, body cam footage, court records, etc.   


We were up to about 400 posts per day, spread out across all of our pages, when Facebook started disabling our admin accounts for ""posting too much"", regardless of how much our followers enjoyed the content.  


I made the difficult decision to transition all pages (and future pages) to Reddit. I found out quickly that I could only create so many subreddits at a time - I'm currently in ""Subreddit jail"" for the next 3 days ;)   


However, reading this thread gives me hope that moving to Reddit will ultimately be the right choice. I invested a lot into Facebook, and it's really sad what they have become, but my followers and I agree that this is the right decision. Thank you, u/spez, for being so vocal - regardless of whether the response is positive or not.   


My one major disappointment is that I can't seem to target cities using Reddit Ads. I can only target the state as a whole. There are a lot of areas we don't cover, and I feel like targeting the entire state wouldn't be very cost-effective.  


Here's to many more 'cake days'..."

Please listen to your users one more time and remove all these useless things. I'm really glad you listened to us and removed profile pics in comments, that was great! Please do it one more time and shut 86 useless rewards down. 

We don't need another Facebook where you can like the post jn 100 different ways. This is Reddit. I loved it in the way it used to be. Please save its glorious and remove all this useless stuff.

Well, I understand that you need money. Instead of making different awards you can improve Gold and Platinum ones. As example, I would suggest making Gold and Platinum holders able to personalize their Reddit appearance. Change colours of the page, font, links and they are the only ones who can see it, you know, everyone loves customisation.

1598562968.0|announcements|StreamRider7|"The problem with Reddit is not the policy on hate or vulnerability, I've seen very little of it. The problem that I have consistently seen are the following:

* Mod's effectively acting as censors on subs such as Israel, Iran, Conservatives
* Creating sufficiently vague rules that Mods can interpret them as they see fit to ban posters. The rules need to be ironclad specific and not selectively enforced.
* There is no 3 strikes and you're out policy. It is simply one and done based on the Moderators point of view or mood when banning
* The deliberate attempt to create a sort of echo-chamber where differing points of views are purposely removed on technicalities
* In the case of /Iran sub, it is actually state backed propaganda being pushed
* There is no effective oversight of the Mods who have unlimited power and discretion
* There is no means for voting or selecting the mods or rules by members of the community. Its dictated to us. 

The platform needs rules for Moderators and efforts to protect free, polite but dissenting speech. It does not do that to the public's detriment."

I'm not ""left"" or ""right"". I agree and disagree with things from both sides. I cherry pick because I have my own mind. No one will put me in a box. Leftists hate me because I hate the victim mentality and I'm honest, those from the right hate me because I don't believe in god or care about being a traditional family man. 

However, there is one thing about the right that I like that the left doesn't have, and that is: most of the time you can have a discussion with them without getting cancelled, censored, insulted or dehumanized. Almost all the time you try this with the left... well, you're just not considered a human with feelings anymore. You're a monster, your life should be ruined, hate, hate hate. No good intentions to be seen towards another fellow human.

Censoring is truly the easiest way of winning. No one can call you out if they can't speak, right? If you think someone is wrong let them speak and make an idiot of themselves. Believing you are the arbiter of truth is the ultimate form of arrogance. 

The excuse of ""hate speech"" will never work. First, because I am convinced people from both sides spewed hate. So you should then ban a lot more leftist subreddits, including the leftist equivalent of The_Donald. Second, there will always be people who feel offended by what someone says. The only question is how many. And to base morality on numbers is really not moral."

My stance is that only an individual themselves has the right to decide whether or not they grant another person consent, yet. Radical, I know, but it's understandable you'd have that reaction given the many times you've established how little you think of a woman's cognitive capabilities.

> ""Some women really like to be raped, meaning that although she is consenting and therefore is not really a rape, everything else is exactly the same : the guy wants to rape her, she struggles, he does it anyway, he thinks he raped her, but she actually loved it. It's her kink, she thinks that since he risked prison to rape her, he really must have wanted her, which is exactly what she wants and her wants are very valid"".

This has nothing to do with what I said. A woman can be capable of giving consent without it meaning that *any time* she engages in sexual activity it is consensual. If a woman doesn't want to have sex there is no consent, plain and simple. If a man has sex with a woman that is protesting - verbally or physically - or that hasn't granted him consent then that is rape, there is no presumed consent that comes with a woman being capable of giving consent.

For example, we recognize that children aren't capable of consenting to sex. If a 30 year old man rapes a 10 year old girl even if she said it was okay that doesn't mean it was - this is because the child lacks the proper understanding of the weight of the decision she is making, she isn't aware of the possible ramifications for her decision, and because the man as an adult is in a position of power to manipulate and expose the child's vulnerability. A 30 year old woman is capable of giving consent to that same 30 year old man, but she is just as capable of revoking consent. Her simply having the mental capacity and understanding to grant consent does not mean it's always granted. She can choose not to give consent or withdraw consent at any moment for any reason and if the man refuses to obey he is raping her.

You're being incredibly disingenuous with this argument.

> So even if we were to believe such prostitutes exist, since you cannot prove that a prostitute really wants to have sex with the old man as the difference between A and B all resides in her head, **we cannot simply take her word for it**

This is a problem that only you are having and I'm not going to hold your hand through it simply because you refuse to trust women or think them capable of the cognitive ability required with giving consent. If we cannot simply take a woman's word for it when she grants consent than women are untrustworthy creatures incapable of deciphering their own wants and motivations, so how can we trust her word when she doesn't grant consent anymore? Clearly the solution is to just ignore a woman's consent all together. This is what you're arguing in favor for. How about we just trust women with our own bodies and decisions and allow us to consent with or revoke consent from whoever we so choose for whatever reason we deem fit? This is the same respect we give men.

> I clearly hate women and my ""fixation"" on them has nothing to do with the discussion of the closing of the 1st feminist sub,

If you're referring to gender critical I don't consider any sub that stands to demonize and target one of the most vulnerable groups of women today as feminist, but clearly our opinion on what is feminist differs very much since yours is dependent upon taking away women's rights and mine is dependent upon empowering women to be and do what they want without pressure from any external systems.

The fact that you screenshot a picture of me arguing in favor of women's consent as the catalyst for this outrage is illustrative of your entire problem - women's right to choose and govern our own bodies.

If I want to have sex with someone I will. If I don't I won't. That's it. I'm sorry you're so upset by my bodily autonomy but I'll leave that to you to figure out on your own since this conversation is far beyond the point of being productive and it's not worth discussing it with you further."

I'm not usually a big proponent of the whole ""only WE can say certain things"" mindset among liberal idpol type people, but slurs are probably the one and only topic in which I agree with them. ""Uncle Tom"" is a word used by black people to disparage other black people - YOU as a white man have absolutely zero business calling a woman ""the uncle tom of women"".

1597687198.0|announcements|sinekonata|"So to you the money is what guarantees that you want to make it. And the more they pay, the more you feel it's appreciated and the more you want to make the ""gift"".

Meaning there's no way of differentiating your situation (A.) from that of a person who just hates making the object but makes it for the money (B.). That's very clever and convenient. I guess the equivalent of your paid rape apologist argument for unpaid rape apologists would be :   
""Some women really like to be raped, meaning that although she is consenting and therefore is not really a rape, everything else is exactly the same : the guy wants to rape her, she struggles, he does it anyway, he thinks he raped her, but she actually loved it. It's her kink, she thinks that since he risked prison to rape her, he really must have wanted her, which is exactly what she wants and her wants are very valid"".

Out of precaution, to avoid raping women, we don't start by assuming that there might be a chance that she loves it but still needs to be coerced into it, or that coercion is exactly what makes them feel appreciated.

So even if we were to believe such prostitutes exist, since you cannot prove that a prostitute really wants to have sex with the old man as the difference between A and B all resides in her head, we cannot simply take her word for it and might as well suppose, out of caution to prevent rape, that, as most of them say, they do it because they need the sustenance and wouldn't let the old guy rape them otherwise.

You're the one who needs to rethink its liberal individualistic cowardly views. I was never talking of individuals and their ""valid experiences"", I'm talking systemically. So yes, in a world without oppression/coercion, we would not be having this discussion, I don't care what women do with their bodies as long as they're not coerced into it, which today they clearly are, and you're still defending their rapists, you horrible cowardly traitor.

\> your hyper fixation on *women* and *our* financial exchanges makes me doubtful of the sincerity of your argument here  
Sure, I'm actually a misogynist, I clearly hate women and my ""fixation"" on them has nothing to do with the discussion of the closing of the 1st feminist sub, only with controlling women like a good patriarch. STFU, enough of your rape apologist women traitor pimping.

You do realise preventing ""hate speech"" means no longer supporting free speech, right? You can do one or the other (hopefully free speech), but not both, and ""prevention"" in this context is really nothing but censorship.

Further, there's no definition of what ""hate speech"" is - it's a loose blanket term, and the words and phrases it covers can easily expand over time since not everyone is ""offended"" by the same things. Therefore, choosing to ban ""hate speech"" just isn't a viable option, since people will be blindsided and punished for something they and many others would consider harmless but the loud minority consider ""offensive""."

The Senior Editor

We have multiple confirmations that a vaccine for COVID 19 not only exists but has existed for some time, since 2019, perhaps as early as 2017.

John Hankey reports that Trump and his inner circle were vaccinated in November 2019, only days after the virus was deployed.

Months ago, VT traced the creation of the current versions of COVID 19/SARS COV 2 to a USAID-CIA funded and peer reviewed study done by the University of North Carolina by scientists closely aligned with America’s defense community.

We are also told that COVID 19, as VT reported in March, was deployed against China, then Italy, then France, then Iran and Spain and then the US as a “fund raiser.”

COVID 19 is the ultimate “sanction” and ultimate tool to bring about that “New World Order” we have been hearing about.  Now we see it as a reality.

This article contains hard proof that cannot be questioned or denied, which you may submit to any government agency or healthcare professional.

What is not yet proven but coming into focus is that the US biological weapons program at Fort Detrick, Maryland, equipment and certainly key staff, certainly migrated to secret labs at large state universities in order to “hide in plain sight.”

Please for the love of all that is holy, give us the ability to screen ALL image posts from new/young accounts.

They're not including links, and not using any keywords we can ban. Instead they gain interest of users and dm them. This makes it currently impossible to prevent. I ban one, and remove the post, and another account just posts another image. It's gotten to the point where I'm looking to move our 20K+ users elsewhere or just ban images 100%.

1597181119.0|announcements|Torboy007|This was exactly what I thought- And how do we know that Reddit isn't in bed with the DNC in terms of Donations? I think Reddit should have to publicly disclose it's finances, including IRS tax returns, as well as the IRS Tax Returns of all of it's employees,  in order to be allowed to have ads of any kind on its platform AT ALL.
1597179770.0|announcements|Torboy007|The problem i see with this is that this kind of policy is election tampering in and of itself, especially if Reddit, Inc. ever made a single political campaign contribution to a member of either political party.- which would mean that Reddit then must effectively recuse itself of administering political ads at all (instead leaving it to disinterested third parties that haven't made campaign contributions of any kind to either party)  because such would be a conflict of interest.
1597178425.0|announcements|Torboy007|"The problem I see with this is that there needs to be made a clear distinction in the rule that makes the distinction between something that attacks someone's values, and something that promotes hate. For example- The fact that someone doesn't accept homosexuality does not make them ""anti-gay"" in the slightest.  Otherwise, we're headed for the same ruins that Facebook is becoming, with moderation getting more tied up in fee-fees versus demonstrating actual clear-cut rule violations. 

It also needs to be made clear that the rules are a two-way street and there needs to be consistent, swift, and extremely severe enforcement against the moderators on some of the more liberal subs that are consistently violating the moderator guidelines."

tldr: helped codify RSS, assisted in Markdown's development, web.py's development, helped organize Creative Commons, and was one of the first real and effective online activists, assisting groups like Fight For the Future to fight bills that restrict and hurt the Internet and raise awareness through quality web design and informative videos.

He was caught downloading JSTOR articles and they gathered some charges on him. He hanged himself -- allegedly -- before it could go to trial.

The Internet and the world lost a bright soul, for setting free information that every American paid for through their taxes or through inflated prices at market.

1596681330.0|announcements|HTPDon1947|"Hidden Treasure Productions began in January of this year with the same high hopes that many other endeavors had. Don’t get me wrong! We still have high hopes and are going forward with the great desire to be successful! However, the onset of Coronavirus has caused us to be creative. Fortunately for us, our company is made up of “creative types!” 

Early on, the decision was made to hold all auditions and rehearsals online through Zoom Technology. That has worked out surprisingly well. We had also planned to start meeting as a live cast in early August. The Jury is still out on that one, but we are hopeful that we will soon be able to rehearse outside in someone’s back yard in groups of less than 10. Living in a nice climate allows us to do that, even in the autumn months.  

We currently have a perfect venue booked for October 9-11, 2020. However, if we must change the dates to early November, due to CDC gatherings restrictions, then that is what we’ll do. We must all be adaptive in this new world we are living in today! Our Director, Valerie Herrera, has put together a stellar cast. Many of the performers are professional actors and have extensive resumes. 

Make plans to come out to see “Shadows of the Mind” in downtown Oceanside, California. The definite dates will be forthcoming and will be posted on the Hidden Treasure Productions website.  [https://hiddentreasureproductions.org](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/5464046714808358737/6752820149591034478#)

Our ultimate goal is to take our production internationally in the Spring of 2021, either to the U.K. or to Ukraine. Plans are still underway to accomplish this. All of this to say, “Ain’t no COVID gonna’ keep us down!”

Written by Beverly Dennison,

HTP Director of Communication"

No, I ignored the irrelevant wrong thing that wasn't important, and fixed your incorrect statement to make actual sense. This is not 'cherry picking' anything; I'm correcting your incorrect statements, because you really don't comprehend what you're talking about, and you're conflating discrete concepts, and you don't even know that you're using the wrong ""logical argument terminology"" words. 

> giving more of your contact info to a site is more of a privacy risk. This is not complicated arithmetic.

Then what's *my* email? 

The email doesn't exist in a vacuum, ***but it's not fucking relevant because Reddit does nothing at all with that email beyond verification of the account holder.*** They do not contact you with it, and nothing on Reddit can connect to it to use it for identification in any way. My verified username doesn't personally identify me in any manner beyond to that username; my spam mail isn't showing up on Reddit feeds, and my Reddit comments don't affect my spam mail. They are insulated by a metaphorical vacuum because there's no connection between them. And guess what? Using the email address to send confirmation of the username *still doesn't add any connection between those two things.* Neither does using my device's camera to pull an algorithm from a QR code which has been associated to my username.

Factually, it *protects* your privacy, because it gives you a method to verify your credentials (which, if you recall, are made up by you yourself in the first place, because you choose your own username and password) without having to use your email address. If it sent you an email every time to make sure it was still you, then anyone looking over your shoulder while you do it can get your username, can't they?"

You mean, ""In other words, your anonymous email is literally and exactly that, and two-factor authentication using it is not personally identifiable."" Which was my exact and explicit point. The fact that your typing style is traceable through anything that you write is not relevant to that fact. The fact that your IP can be used to track your shopping habits is also not relevant to that fact. The fact that the email address can be on a list somewhere is not relevant, because it isn't visibly attached to your Reddit username unless you make a post about how your username uses that email address.

I have to scroll through all my pictures just to find the image i want to add. And its not sorted by latest but with all folders after each other. It is very hard to post stuff now, especially multible! Please fix this, reddit."

Any way to select the source? Or am I stuck?"

1596546231.0|announcements|tylerr514|"This is a bad demo... it is already bugging out for me!
  
After reading some comments and going to swipe back to the first image, it wouldn't let me.
  
also the swiping requires you to swipe VERY horizontally.
  
sometimes the images go completely black

1596539942.0|announcements|KMSyahid123|Is it available for mobile?
1596539930.0|announcements|Garlic-dough-balls|"How can you see the full image in the mobile app? 

For example looking at this post on the website Vs on the android app 

Within the website I see the full image top to bottom and left to right. 

On the current official android app the image is cropped to a square aspect ratio cutting off part of the bottom of the image and some off the sides. 

While for this image on this post it's not a huge problem, subs with images including text screenshots for example up to half the image is missing. Makes reading text based image posts very difficult. You loose detail on portrait images where parts are cut off. 


Thanks.


Edit. Just seen this has already been answered.  An update coming soon.  

Thanks."
