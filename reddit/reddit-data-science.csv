1601863604.0|science|Neolife|"Our approach would be an IM injection, though there are also approaches with an inhaled delivery, to coat the lungs with the nanobody and attack the virus prior to infection.

Monoclonal antibodies and nanobodies are actually quite similar to one another. While typical antibodies have a larger antibody-binding region and a constant region, nanobodies in their simplest form have just a small antibody-binding region and no constant region. There are also constructs that conjugate the antibody-binding region of the nanobody to the constant region from human or other mammalian antibodies, called Nb-hcAbs (for nanobody - heavy-chain antibodies), which act very similar to classical antibodies but can be more potent.

So to sum that up, I don't know of any active nanobody treatments for autoimmune disease, but the similarities between those monoclonal antibody drugs and nanobody-based drugs can be incredibly high, to the extent where it would be highly probable that a nanobody-based drug would be able to replicate or improve upon the effects of a mAb for most conditions, at least that's what I would theorize based on my experience."

1601863459.0|science|Wormsblink|"Pharma scientist here, although I do purification work instead of antibody design.

Antibodies are like legos, they can be built in many combinations to “fit” the target biological substance. Binding critical proteins on the virus (like the spike protein it uses to enter cells) can “block” and disable it.

Nanobodies are like minimalist antibodies, they only contain the portion that binds. This is very useful since they will have a much smaller molecule which is more stable, causes less immune response and are excreted faster from the body. Also they can be produced in bacteria instead of mammal cells, which makes it far easier.

For the work in this paper (which I unfortunately can’t access), I believe they use phage display instead of an actual alpaca. Basically a huge amount of bacteriophages (viruses) are synthesized, then tested on the target protein. The protein coat around the virus allows it to possibly bind to the target protein if you’re lucky, but with millions - billions of different phases you’re likely to get a few hits. The bacteriophage with the best binding ability is identified, then sequenced to get the amino acid sequence.

The sequence can be used to construct antibodies, which the researchers can choose to use standard antibodies or in this case a nanobody from an alpaca. They just need to change the “lego” pieces on the antibody to the sequence they got from phage display.

So theoretically, it should be possible to build the antibody / nanobody from any mammal, including mice and humans. It just happens that nanobodies are useful so they went with camelids, specifically alpacas."

And part of this is because scientists will have exact same questions you have ;)

So yeah, part of the the puzzle will also be to figure out how to get those proteins into your body (because they can probably be  broken down as foreign entities by our immune system). These nanobodies might never even a chance to attack the coronavirus.

The study also only mentions ""heavier"" use of alcohol during the first 6-7 weeks, which is defined at 36 drinks total (which is 6 drinks a week, the same number that was previously defined as ""low"" drinking). 

Of course, like most of these studies, the big problem is that it seems to have just asked women how many total drinks they had a week, not how much they had in one setting. 1 drink a day for a week might have a totally different impact than 7 drinks in 1 night and no drinks the other 6, but you can't tell from the study."

From that they took the active antigen-blocking part of the heavy chain and cut off the rest to make an even smaller nanobody protein. They've been investigated for cancer research because the smaller nanobodies not only fit into more places, but they also can be easier to make since you only need 1 genetic sequence to make a fully functional nanobody.

As to why evolution has maintained the 4 chain version, it's because it increases the amount of variability possible. All proteins up to tertiary structure are single strings folded onto themselves, so having an entire separate protein join up(quaternary structure) to make a functional antibody allows for addition complexity without compromising stability, like making origami from 2 pieces of paper instead of 1."

1601854474.0|science|MeanEYE|"While I don't have medical degree, I can talk about RF penetration in regards to WIFI as I worked for some years on establishing few ISPs here that were solely based on long distance WIFI.

Basically, penetrating power of 2.4GHz is not that big and loses energy very fast. In our usage case we had couple of watts of emitting power with a very directional antenna and smaller tree would reduce reduce signal by a huge amount, almost 2/3 of it. Not very scientific but hear me out. So we used anywhere from 2W to 5W power to emit long distances. Common house-hold WIFI routers are usually around 100 or 150mW. Orders of magnitude lower power and therefore very bad penetration. Apply inverse square law and your power drops significantly at even one meter. Not to mention antennas on WIFI routers are omnidirectional antennas covering 360°.

All that said, the higher you go in frequency lower the penetration power. At 5.8GHz penetration is significantly lower. Think about this in [sine waves](https://www.wifi-professionals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wave-length.png). In case of 5.8GHz signal has to travel longer though obstacle of same thickness.

---

So, inverse square law which is `i = 1 / r²`. If 360° antenna has 100mW at source, some 36° which are pointing at you would have 10mW. That's at source (let's say 1cm). At one meter distance it would have been much much much lower than what they tested for, it would have been around 0.0001mW. For comparison, signal strength devices around your home are receiving are anywhere between -50dBm and -100dBm, or in mW 0.00001 and 0.0000000001 respectively. Very very very low as you can see."

Hanke, L., Vidakovics Perez, L., Sheward, D.J. et al. 

Nature Communications volume 11, Article number: 4420 (2020) 

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18174-5

Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through an interaction between the spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. Ty1 binds the RBD with high affinity, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 Å resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformations, sterically hindering RBD-ACE2 binding. While fusion to an Fc domain renders Ty1 extremely potent, Ty1 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus as a 12.8 kDa nanobody, which can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19."

We have no baseline of what could count as safe or what (outside of common sense) would dictate dangerous. Most doctors and governments recommend no alcohol at all because of the fact that we have very little idea of what constitutes 'safe'. The general stance is ""well if we don't know what IS safe, we should assume it isn't safe at all for the health and wellness of the baby."" It can lead to a lot of women feeling extreme guilt for drinking during the period of time that they were pregnant but not yet aware of that fact.

You do not have the 'right' to drive a car on public roadways. you petition your local government for permission to operate that vehicle on the publicly owned roadways, and in exchange for that permission, you agree to follow the laws regarding that operation. This is known as voluntary participation. There is no right associated with operating a vehicle, or using it to travel on public roadways. Ergo, the powers that be, do have the authority to regulate that activity.

The  way you break this down is simple. Drop a person in the middle of the woods, naked, with no tools. What can they do? you can talk. you can eat. you can sleep. you can create makeshift clothing and wear it. you can make a makeshift domicile and live in it. they can craft weapons and use them to defend their life and property.

Although I will make a slight modification, and say that for efficiency's sake, instead of the device sitting at room temperature, it would be part of a heatsink assembly on a computer.

We can convert heat into electricity using thermal expansion (piezoelectrics between layers of material, perhaps something like this: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/773/1/012073/pdf). Mechanically removing heat from an object to charge a circuit seems perfectly plausible. There does have to be a temperature gradient for it to work, which is why I chose not to have the device just sitting on a table at room temperature, for comparison's sake.

Now, I will certainly admit that there is room to argue whether or not this energy transfer could be done on an atomic scale with a diode.

1601837655.0|science|DPJazzy91|Right now our only method for creating energy from heat is to run expanding gas or liquid through a turbine.

Their energy output is going to be pretty low though.  I highly doubt that the energy per square foot can get high enough to make it useful and something like a reactor.  I see it as more of an extra layer on solar panels to boost efficiency and get a little more energy out of them.  But mainly as uninterrupted constant power for some microelectronics in computers.

It could power low voltage sensors, so they never go offline. It could also be used to harvest additional heat out of exhaust from turbines, and other engines, or really any heat sources.  Print a layer of them underneath solar panels.  Use some of that heat to get more juice per square foot of panel.

The whole circuit is kept at the same temp.

Apparently there was some detectable current (AC) even without the diodes. However the wattage was ridiculously low. Adding the diodes which would norally decrease efficiency of a  circuit, actually increased it because it allowed an electron concentration to build up enough to overcome the resistance of the wire.

Btw we are still likely talking about femtowatts of power. 

But because the actual size of the graphene would be inconsequential to the number of electrons tunneling the diode (because only the electron beside the diode matters) millions of these circuits could be combined in parallel theoretically to produce microwatts of power.

Here in lies the problem, unless your goal is to convert heat in to heat a micrometre away, you need an extremely efficient conductor (like more double layers of graphene) to transmit the electrons far enough to actually connect millions of these circuits in parallel, and have an abundance of them to do work with other than make more heat."

This is what's confusing to me. How are they generating cooling if everything in the system is in thermal equilibrium? They say there's thermal fluctuations in the graphene sheet, but if you're able to harvest energy from them you would be continually cooling the graphene sheet, similar to evaporation off of a puddle.

Are they actually getting some differential heating of the graphene sheet from light in the room or picking up energy from E&M waves in the environment?

The point is you cannot just make masks mandatory at a stage where you have not good evidence on how the virus spreads. It could spread by touch, by droplets. Even spread by aerosols (which masks dont help against) is not ruled out to this day.

>Why do people wear surgical masks in hospitals?

Surgeons wear masks for a completely different reason, namely that if you operate on a patient, you need to protec the patient from the germs of the surgical team.

If you're asking why surgical masks are generally worn in hospitals during covid? Well, if you don't know what might help, you use anything you have available, not only limited to masks but also different protection like gloves etc.

Also, 6 drinks a week is not what most would consider low-consumption.

Because if your name *doesn't* get called you're basically telling parents that their child's access to a free and appropriate public education is going to be curtailed - without parent consent. And there's the whole mindset of parents who see taxes and schools as being a transaction where they have purchased curtain outcomes. But parents aren't the clients of an educational institution, their kids are. 

 This is easier to handle of you say that all students of a particular class - say all students classified as at risk - are *guaranteed* a seat, and all non-at-risk (however a school wishes to define it) will remain in distance learning with no choice for a certain length of time. 

Otherwise you may end up with students whose situations are actually identical but have received a different outcome because one received a golden ticket and the other did not. I know some schools have done this lottery thing but I would be worried that a family would file suit if they didn't win - and have a shot of being correct on the merits of the case. Random may be fair in one sense but still be discriminatory in another. 

It'll also depend on the rules set in place by the state educational agency. Over here, the by-line is all instruction must be ""equivalent"" but need not be ""identical"" between distance learners and on campus students. This is a rule I know for a fact isn't required (or being enforced) elsewhere where distance learners are receiving a much watered down version of the curriculum compared to their on campus peers. 

So in short, I'm wary of the reasonableness of putting random chance in the driver's seat when it comes to ensuring **equity**, even if every child is being treated *equally* under such a lottery system. Those weighted criteria will only go so far."
