Then from the 50: 1st down no gain, 2nd down no gain, 2rd down another 30-yd pass attempt, incomplete, but oh no PASS INTERFERENCE PLACE BALL AT SPOT OF FOUL. So now they have the ball at the 20-yd line from doing nothing at all, just riding 60 yards JUST from the penalties.

Now they have the ball at the 20. 1st down no gain 2nd down no gain 3rd down they attempt the endzone but OH NO PASS INTERFERENCE BALL PLACED AT ONE YARD LINE AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. So now they have the ball at the 1, from doing absolutely nothing at all, they just rode penalties to get there. Then they take 3 downs to punch in 1 yard and get a touchdown.

On the one hand, websites like Reddit and 4chan do represent the public and citing them for information regarding journalism is becoming more common.

On the other hand, they're letting redditors do the hard work of producing the content, then just picking the already voted cream of the crop and repackaging it with minimal effort.

Overall, fairly negative. But then again, there are youtube channels which consist of ""pretty girl, doing regular things and videoing it while occasionally talking about interesting things"" or ""gamer guy plays horror game and has massive overreactions to everything he sees"" which proceed to gets thousands of views daily.

As I was pushing off the ground to recover the ball, another friend jumped on it and my arm at the same time.  I heard the pop of my bone and felt the pain.  My sister, of course, insisted I was faking it and made me sit at the kitchen table until my parents got home from work, which was about 3 hours.  So my dad comes home and sees my arm about twice it's normal size and takes me to the hospital.  It was indeed broken and I got a free souvenir cast!

I had to have a surgical kneecap realignment (also called tibial tubercle osteotomy and elevation).  The surgery went great and I was home within 3 days.   About 48 hours of being home I got thirsty and needed to go to the fridge.   The issue though is I'm the 2nd floor and the fridge is on the first.  But whatever,  I had crutches and I started making my way down the flight of stairs.   I made it about 4 steps down, when all of a sudden my cat flew right by my crutches and startled me.  I fell face forward down 24 steps and during the fall my legs bend completely back.  I heard this awful zipper noise from the leg which I come to find out was the staples (80 of them) ripping out of my surgical wound.   I completely black out on the bottom of the stairs and come to with my cat looking at me.   I have these immobilizers on my leg so I just compress the leg tighter and get up.   Again, thinking I didn't really screw my leg up.   I end up getting my drink and go back upstairs.   Not knowing how much damage I have done I lay down and take a nap.   About 2 hours after my mom wakes me up screaming and I look down and my stabilizer and bed completely red.  They call and ambulance who took me to the hospital and when I saw my Artho he said something I never heard another doctor say.  Are you a FUCKING IDIOT!  YOU ALMOST DIED TODAY!

Result - I ended up breaking 3 different areas including knee cap in half.  The zipper noise was actually all the stitches came out.   I also started getting and infection and almost like 2 pints of blood due to one of screws going into a vein or something.

Lesson learned?  Nothin, I was thirsty."

Because it's proven to be effective and I don't believe doctors that talk about demon sex in dreams and bleach. That isn't science, that isn't medicine. I also didn't need the media to tell me any of that, I have a memory, I remember how SARS put the world in panic mode for a minute way back when. Precaution should never be labeled as paranoia. Masks seem self explanatory, as most of Asia adopted their use during the afformentioned prequel epidemic. 

I'm not the brightest knife in the old toolbox, but I do have some common sense. It's not about control, the government gassing and beating its own citizens is about control. This is basic decency during a global pandemic. I also long ago moved past the whole conspiracy mindset. The world is a disorganized shitshow, most everyone's just grinding to get by, not everything is a fucking conspiracy. Yet the internet goes wild, calls it a plandemic, anti-maskers spread their disinformation across every social media platform, and can't seem to fathom the idea that they're protecting other people. Like *what the fuck, America.*

I see why psychologists said that people who refuse to wear masks exhibit signs of psychopathy or sociopathy. There's *no regard* for the well being of others, *whatsoever*. They think everyone's a sheep, which is a reg flag word in-and-of itself. It's some frightening delusional thinking. Hell, I know a person who has labeled everyone who wears masks as mentally ill. That shit stings like all hell. The world is burning and nobody seems to be able to muster a fuck."

1601864840.0|AskReddit|MeX1canBurrit0|Not neccesarily. This is why their is a food chain. Because different animals over power others but in the grand scheme of things that is what keeps the balance. If one animal was to have no real predator the scale would tip more towards one side and all would follow. Weak and defenseless is too subjective to generalize. For example worms thrive but they all  are weak and defenseless to virtually every creature, in comparision rats and mice would take over all the worms and they would cease to exist but hawks fly down and eat the rats and mice thus keeping balance so that way everything in this world lives and when its time is to die out it will do so when the conditions are right. A baby elephant is still a baby but has the power to stomp over and kill a human if it needed to. At some point when we were closely like apes even being an infant was hard but we had are advantages just like baby elephants do ,its why we have survived so long and haven't died out since or been over taken by another species.

1601864834.0|AskReddit|DrossDespondent|"Over 4,000 know religions, how can only one be correct? Yet, if I believed every story I heard, I wouldn't even be able to walk down the street without fear of the sky falling. You know, Jesus wasn't the only one who claimed to be the child of God. Jim Jones faked his ability to heal physical afflictions with faith alone, he claimed it was because he was the son of God. It ended in a litany of abuse and the mass suicide of numerous men, women, and children. That is not a unique story, it had happened before and it happened after. At some point, you have to realize that the stories were created out of self-interest. 

Furthermore, any God could only exist outside of all known laws of physics and chemistry. The first law of thermodynamics, the law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed - only converted from one form of energy to another. 

Early in the 20th century, Einstein figured out that even mass is a form of energy (this is called mass-energy equivalence). The amount of mass directly relates to the amount of energy, as determined by the most famous formula in physics: E=mc2. Yet, God is told to have created the world and man out of sheer willpower. He is always, He is whatever mass or energy he chooses to be. He exists outside of the system, perpetuated only by our magical thinking. 

There are very specific biological process in the brain that cause thought to occur. In order for your brain to think, you need nerve cells that can detect information about the outside world and can transmit that information to other nerve cells. It’s the transmission of information, the cells talking to each other, that’s the fundamental physical basis for how thinking works. When a single neuron fires, it is an isolated chemical blip. When many fire together, they form a thought. By extension, the whole brain is also an electrochemical machine. The neurons are connected in enormous networks. The receiving neuron registers the chemical signal and converts it to a new electrical signal, which is computed in the neuron's central body. 

One to five minutes after death, the brain is hit by a process called terminal spreading depolarization (SD) – or, in less scientific terms, a “brain tsunami”. In its most basic form, this is a wave of neuron activity that starts in the deeper brain structures and radiates outwards, unlike the previous burst of neuron activity, which hits all areas of the brain simultaneously. Importantly, it signifies the breakdown of the brain’s electrochemicals (the substances responsible for keeping our neurons alive and functioning) and marks the point at which the capacity for brain function and awareness are lost. 

When brain activity has ceased, thought continuing to occur would defy the law of conservation of energy in both physics and chemistry. Meanwhile, the blood forms clots, the fat liquefies, and the corpse turns a lovely green color. All the while, the body’s enzymes continue to digest its own organs. Those without much fibrous content (such as the brain) will be the first to go. Those with more fiber (like the heart and uterus) will stick around longer. 

The rotting body is becoming a sweet home for flies, maggots, and other insects. “Almost from the moment of death, or even before in some cases, flies will lay eggs on the body – usually around the nose, mouth, and eyes, and maggots will hatch and begin to consume the body,” Hamilton told IFLScience. By day seven, the greedy grubs are able to consume up to 60 percent of the corpse. 

As decomposition proceeds, anaerobic bacteria primarily within the intestinal tract, produce gases resulting in bloating followed by the purge of fluids and subsequent release of nutrients and microbes into the underlying soil. 

These processes of decomposition are the conservation of energy at work. The total energy remains constant, and is conserved over time. That is evident, at no point does your brain teleport to some mystical realm where you get everything you want. The biological processes in your brain, no longer have a place to occur. Just as a God has no system to support his ethereal existence. 

Furthermore and to quote Epicurus, ""Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"""

The only true statement you could make is that the dogs in two cartoons you could think of and another you couldn't were great Danes. that  would not be much of a statement, but it would be true.  They way you worded it is just plain false, there are many old school cartoons with many different breeds of dogs and great Danes are no more common than other breeds.

The only cartoon dog from old school cartoons like The Jetsons, Scooby-Doo, Clifford, (one other old cartoon that ive forgotten now) that isn't a great dane is Clifford."

Then, FINALLY, you are old enough to get away (14 to 18) and if you're lucky, you have a lot of excuses to not go places with them - practices, games, rehearsals, concerts, homework, a job.... and so on.

When you're an adult, if you have the balls to do so, you start to point out to them in the moment how absurd and ridiculous they are acting and they learn to not act that way around you... but they still do it when you're not around.  You're not around a lot."

Hours away from it) and so the dude goes ""so are you guys visiting a family member?"" Because none of us, especially me, were acting like anything was actually about to happen. And so I replied with ""nope I'm the one having the procedure"" and he said ""you are the calmest person going into a heart procedure I've ever met""
(Btw, I have WPWS and had to have an ablation done. Fun times.)

Oh also, a month beforehand, when we found out I had WPWS, I was rushed to the hospital for my heart rate being over 217 or something and all like 7 of the doctors with me in my hospital room loved me cause all I did was talk about how I'm happy to be missing classes and that I didn't do my geometry hw the night before.

1601864688.0|AskReddit|nothingbeatagoodshit|I recently have been talking to a psychologist. And I have gotten a new job due to Covid in a field I’d never considered before. I’m still drowning in debt and I’m such a cynical twat that I just really told the psychologist what they wanted to hear to make the session go quicker. But my life is still a bit better. Everything I’m doing is my decision. I’m doing the job well. I’m cleaning and doing what adults are supposed to do. I feel like perhaps I do deserve to be happy or feel affection at some point. The pessimist part of me says I’ll get diagnosed with terminal cancer the second I allow myself any internal peace. But at least I’m not thinking about how the world would be better off if I was dead anymore. It makes me feel a little taller. I guess that’s something.

1601864682.0|AskReddit|GottaBelieveInTrees|"I was taking Synthroid in college and as a new teacher, and things were okay until I had to get checked by a new doctor who 'didn't like my numbers' and changed my prescription to triple the dosage.  2 months later, I had to fly into Anchorage after passing out in front of a class full of sophomores because my heart rhythm was so wonky.  My old doctor canceled the Synthroid completely after running all kinds of heart function tests (echocardiograms are really freaky to watch when your heart is literally skipping beats) and diagnosed V-fib made worse by stress and overmedication.  Oddly, blood tests a few months later showed all my thyroid markers as fine.  I guess the shock of too much Synthroid made the gland stop overproducing TSH- just had to scare the heck out of me to do it.

Now, I have a lot of the symptoms of hypothyroidism, but none of the markers in my blood.  So the doc just keeps checking whatever she can think of and I just make do."

But while we had it, we were both bedridden. I was delirious with fever, and apparently I had started speaking gibberish at one point until my boyfriend gave me a cold shower. The two weeks that I was sick are very difficult to remember. I remember crying in pain at one point and seriously believing I was going to die. My boyfriend didn't fare much better. We're both very very fortunate that we're young and have good health. Not everyone makes it, and not everyone is lucky enough to be unscathed afterward like us.

Once everyone realized, they ran to her and the first thing she said after coming to was “ow, my back kinda hurts”. She just wanted to get up and stretch because she thought that was the problem so everyone held her down until the helicopter arrived. One of the guys taking down info during the ride told us that when he asked allowed to the others “does anyone know this girl’s social?”, she lifted her head and correctly and casually gave the man the number, even while being severely concussed along with broken ribs, cracked vertebrae, and a punctured lung.

1601864655.0|AskReddit|Awesomejuggler20|I've been driving for about 4 and a half years and I drive daily so I do have a little experience. Use your turn signal EVERY SINGLE TIME you make a turn no matter what (yes this includes in a parking lot). It's illegal to not signal a turn. Your signal is there for a reason. Not for a decoration. It's my driving pet peeve when people don't signal. Especially if I'm behind them. Also, if you're turning left at a flashing green light.... Do NOT make your turn if the light is no longer flashing and there's oncoming traffic. Once the light goes green for the oncoming traffic, they have the right of way. Not you. Unless you have plenty of time to make your turn before the oncoming light turns green, don't make your turn. If I'm turning left at a flashing green light, doesn't matter if I'm in the intersection already or not, if my light stops flashing green and is just solid green, I will stop and yield to oncoming traffic even if they haven't started going yet. I'll stop in the middle of the intersection if I have to. Can't count the amount of times I've been cut off by driver's ignoring the fact my light went green and they just turn right in front of me as if they still have the flashing light. Happened twice this weekend actually. Once yesterday and once tonight. Last but not least.... If you're turning left at a solid green light and there's a vehicle in the oncoming lane turning right, the vehicle turning right has the right of way. Not you. Only time you would have the right of way is if your light was flashing green.
