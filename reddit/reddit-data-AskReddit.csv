The odds that you were born a human being and just so happen to be on earth at this very point in time is as grand as creation itself. Can you imagine on another distant planet a species asking the exact same question as you right now? Or a civilization being destroyed entirely due to some catastrophic event. In this vast universe what is right now and what has been on this planet is as close as we can get to understanding what lies beyond our own solar system. The odds were in our favor and and we adapted to what we were givin thus making us sentient as we are now. We have been around for a long enough time that something as trivial as defencelessnes  at birth isn't or shouldn't even be a question asked since we have surpassed this point in time a long time ago.

My last celebreity crush would probably be Letitia. She's (IMO of course, feel free to disagree) one of the most attractive black actress. I never saw videos of her outside the Black Panther Movies, but given that she did appear in comicons, I guess she's well appreciated.

I also have the right to scream nonsensical garbage at people walking by on the street, but it doesn't mean it's not disrespectful. 

Whatever agreements you have made with others are where the cheating comes in. Are you sharing something of yourself that you promised to only share with that one person. 

Now we're into the semantics of owning someone's sexual activity. ""Only I can have sex with my SO because they are mine."" It's a very standard concept. What it should be is ""Only I can have sex with my SO because that is what they promised to me."" As there is no ownership, just agreement. 

If the thing you are doing is outside the agreements you have made, then it is cheating. If the things you are doing are not disclosed, then there can be no agreement, so that it's deceit by omission. If the SO knows but doesn't like it, then it is their decision to continue or not, but the agreement is intact as everything is disclosed. If the SO knows and doesn't mind, then all good all round."

I hate that I made them afraid of me, their caretaker, and it always pulls me out and pushes me to calm them down and care for them and be nice, and while I‚Äôm doing that, the anger immediately fades and the depression is lessened. The more I put into caring for them and interacting with them, the less focused I am on my depression. 

tl;dr: actively caring for my pets helps take the focus off of me and puts it into them; sort of an exercise in mindfulness. More effective than DBT if you ask me"

Yeah, I honestly didn't know what to believe about Johnny's innocence in the matter at the beginning either, but it's like a significant part of myself clearly stood up for him without any proof and serious knowledge of the events that led him to that situation. May have been hypocrite when stating that it was obvious he wouldn't resort to violence, but I'm pretty sure of it anyway. Do you happen to know what's the conclusion of the case?

First of all, only your first description is a genius.  Someone who accomplishes things through hard work and dedication could be a genius, or they might not be.  You‚Äôre describing conscientiousness, not intelligence.  Genius is high intelligence, nothing more or less.

Let‚Äôs stop using terms like genius for the finer part of this argument.  Genius typically is accepted to be 160 IQ.  This means you 4 standard deviations from the mean IQ.  3 standard deviations would make you smarter than 99.7% of people.  I‚Äôm not sure the exact math for 4 SDV, but it‚Äôs effectively 99.999%.  Putting you at one in 10,000.  Researchers who look at gifted children actually put true ‚Äúgenius‚Äù level IQ even higher to define that kid who graduates high school around age 13 and is capable of undergraduate level learning in his/her early teens.  They represent this individual as closer to 1 in 1 million.  

Anyway,  why am I talking about this?  Well everyone can‚Äôt do what that 1 in 1 million kid can do.  Everyone also can‚Äôt do what everyone who is a member of the Mensa or whatever it‚Äôs called genius registry at IQ 160.  It does not matter how much hard work you put in,  they will be able to accomplish things you do not have the ability to accomplish, period.  However these people are extremely rare.  Of them, many won‚Äôt reach their full potential anyway.  IQ is actually a rather crappy predictor of success after a certain point. 

Now let‚Äôs talk about more relevant levels of IQ.  Average IQ is 100.  68% of people fall between 85 and 115.  Somewhere between about 115 and 125, IQ stops predicting success.  

Let‚Äôs talk medical school because that is a widely known level of high academic achievement.  A person with an IQ of 115 can go to medical school and likely do fine. However, someone with an IQ of 100 is very unlikely to make it to this level of advanced education, and is very unlikely to do well.  Someone with an IQ of 85 would be very unlikely to complete an undergraduate curriculum in a hard science to even be eligible to apply to medical school.

Let‚Äôs go back to your argument now.  When we talk about that 115 individual, if they apply themself it is likely they can accomplish most things.  The only things that they might do well in would be extremely high level math and physics that require even higher IQ.  However it‚Äôs very unlikely they‚Äôd want to do that anyway.  Most other people are fairly limited by their Innate ability."

Really? How does one go about helping with that? I wouldn't mind offering my story for that! It's not an easy job, the chance to help even a little and show their work will be appreciated no matter what sounds very fulfilling! I'd had a number of miscarriages before her, so that may help them understand a situation slightly more complicated in the grief department (if that makes any sense, all grief is valid and complicated). Come to think of it, that's probably why i was so adamant about getting the ""punchline"" asap. It was always an immediate answer prior - before i could even ask a question. The uncertainty was entirely new, especially for the one who finally ""made it,"" so to speak.

We ARE pregnant again, though! So far, so good. We might be a little overbearing as the little one gets older, but hey! Hope prevails and they'll have a sister up there making sure it doesn't happen to them, you know?"

CueStar, AnotherXYZ, GioFilms, OneTopic, TheClick, Wonderstruck Guy and his crew, Ailiarus aka PANDA DADDY, SorrowTV, and *Fresh* are my favorites. They actually put quite a lot of work into their videos to make them stand out.

I love those guys, I started watching Fresh first, followed by Cue back in 2018. I was subbed to them when they made their 100 subscriber specials.

Next came AnotherXYZ and Ailiarus, about a month later. Wonderstruck came across my feed early 2019, about the same time I discovered GioFilms.

OneTopic is an extremely wholesome guy, I found him during this spring(2020), and he is good friends with TheClick, who I also subscribed to.

Many people have terrible presentation, not the best(if any) voice acting, and mill posts like crazy. Sorrow is taking a break right now, which makes me sad; but he'll be back and his videos are hysterical.

These guys have consistent upload schedules without being over the top. Gio, One Topic and TheClick have nearly everyday or everyday uploads. Wonderstruck does one a week I think? AnotherXYZ, Cue, Ailiarus, and Fresh have schedules that are seemingly random; however they put out decent length videos, that are high quality.

Fresh has to be my all time favorite. Not only for being the first Reddit reader I found, but because the quality of his videos are amazing. You can tell he puts hours into them, his sarcasm is unmatched and I love throwing on his videos even after the 10th time watching them."

There was suppose to be an option to opt out and parents could refuse the flouride treatments but we were forced by the teachers to take the tablets even if our parents didnt sign the waivers giving permission. Wed get recess or lunch taken away and some of the teachers would shove the tablets in our mouths by force. 

A lot of parents were really pissed about it but nothing really changed and we were all just sorta forced to take the fluoride. I have permenant white spots/streaks on all of my teeth as a result of it.

Each teacher had a big pill bottled full of small white unmarked fluoride tablets and would walk around the room every morning giving the tablets.

Turned out I had 3 bigass pulmonary embolisms, which explained why I felt like I was half dead.  That was free - just walk out and say thanks.

Canada's health care system is backed way the fuck up... there are systemic reasons for it.  To name a few, underpayed doctors (kind of like sports teams, why the fuck would you play for a Canadian team when an American team will pay you twice as much), understaffed facilities, and the one you're going for... too many people using the system.

On one hand, if you need it, you should use it.  On the other, when people are going to the emergency room for a fever (literally, every time I can remember being there I've heard the doctor explaining to someone their non-emergency condition).

They use it, because the GPs are all busy and not taking new patients.

Do I like the system?  No.  But about the only thing I'd do is add a co-pay for *electives* and non-emergency (at hospitals) to dissuade abuse of the system."

You can only be hypnotised if you wanted the outcome in the first place. And that‚Äôs just paying someone to tell you what you had planned to do to begin with. In my case I was just going along with what other people wanted.

1601865680.0|AskReddit|bigthama|"No it is not. That's not even close to being the definition of homeopathy.

Homeopathy at its core is the belief that ""like cures like"" as claimed by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century. This was in contrast to allopathy, the idea that effective treatments for disease would likely not be made from the same type of thing as the disease itself. 

Homeopaths believe that by diluting a substance you make it more powerful. Thus, to treat arsenic poisoning, an extremely dilute arsenic solution might be used. The number of dilutions used by modern homeopaths result in solutions where it is statistically improbable for even a single molecule of the treatment to remain. The homeopathic response to this is that ""water has memory"" and retains therapeutic properties of substances even after they are no longer in solution. The implications of this for sewage treatment aside, this means that homeopathic remedies are implausible with respect to basic laws of physics, chemistry, and biology.

Unless this person was receiving 6C dilutions of spiderwebs, then their treatment was not homeopathic. 

Natural remedies are not necessarily homeopathic, and homeopathic remedies are not necessarily natural. Traditional remedies predate homeopathy by millenia, such as traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine. Mainstream, science-based medicine makes use of natural remedies and medicines based on natural remedies all the time. I regularly prescribe aspirin, which is derived from a traditional bark remedy. Penicillin is a natural remedy derived from mold. The only thing that makes these natural, traditional remedies part of mainstream medicine is that science has proven their effectiveness."

One side will win, the other will lose, don‚Äôt rub it in their face, hell don‚Äôt bring it up, don‚Äôt talk about it, don‚Äôt post about it on yourself social media where you know the other person is gonna see it.

1601865541.0|AskReddit|RevanchismRules|"You did what you could with what you had man, it would‚Äôve been worse for it if you‚Äôd left it to suffer longer. Maybe there was a better method but you didn‚Äôt have a lot of time. The only time I had to kill something was a couple of baby rabbits that had some neurological issue- they kept having seizures. I‚Äôd never seen anything like it before, and didn‚Äôt after either. I went with the plastic bag method, but in all likelihood doing what you did would have been better.

I know in college a friends boyfriend was a hunter and came across a deer who had just been hit by a car and was suffering. Without missing a beat he stopped his truck, got out and slit its throat and dragged it to the side of the road out of the way of traffic."

Reading about the NecroLords and the Kyrian makes me feel like the two factions could find a way to divide themselves along which faction they seem superior with maybe a long, arduous quest required to switch from one faction to another like EverQuest 2 (is that game still relevant?) had back in the day."

If it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm comfortable sharing with someone, I will share it but that doesn‚Äôt happen often. I wish I felt like I could talk to more people because sometimes being held while you just cry your heart out is the best thing to help with sadness."

I think they said it was around $100?). Hair appointments for bride and groom (?? 150?). Borrowed a suit for him. Family friend as photographer and dinner at a nearby restaurant as the reception (maybe the most expensive part of the day as they bought all our drinks, we paid for our own food).

1601865530.0|AskReddit|moeriscus|"Ok I am gonna go serious here --- that half the population of humanity (women) are people who have equal rights and human dignity before their Higher Power...  women were basically property for, ohhhh I dunno, thousands upon thousands of years of human development (in the OT, a ""concubine"" is a sex slave). They were not people, fully and legally, until after WWII.... Also see Jim crow in the south. This holds for all oppressed peoples: without socio-economic empowerment, there is no political empowerment. If a woman (or whoever) can't hold property, can't get loans, can't get a bank account, can't divorce or marry their loved one, then how can they be an active citizen? I am a white male, so I can only imagine how awful it was for women and minorities until uuhhh, always"

1601865528.0|AskReddit|Dukem10|"Underdramatic patient here, in high school I woke up one day with steering pain in my abdomen. Thought I had food poisoning or something so went to school. The next day I wake up and it still hurts so I think to myself ""Jesus what did I eat?"" Say oh well and go to school. Third day I wake up and it still hurts so I finally mentioned it to my mother and she freaked out so off to the hospital we went. Sat in the ER for 4 hours relaxing watching TV. We finally get called in and I explain the situation to the doctor/nurse (Don't remember) and they just stare at me for a minute. Next thing I know I am getting rushed in for a CT scan and it turns out that my appendix had ruptured 3 days ago. I was informed several times by the staff that waiting to come in was not the smartest move. Oh well, at least I got to zoom up and down the halls in a wheelchair for a while."

1601865522.0|AskReddit|404__LostAngeles|"Do you honestly believe the only thing you need to worry about is whether your skin is moisturized or not? Like what if people have acne and want to treat it? Should they do nothing? I'm honestly confused about your beliefs. Are you just anti-corporate and believe all the research done on skincare products is fake and they're just trying to sell us stuff? Or do you think humans should live as naturally as possible, without the aid of any products? I'm genuinely curious.

Also, I never said signs of aging are unnatural or unsightly. Obviously as we age our skin will show signs of it, but there's nothing wrong with trying to slow this process. You act like caring about your appearance is somehow a bad thing. Taking care of my skin is just another part of my daily hygiene routine, same as taking a shower and brushing my teeth. Also, it's a fact that UV rays cause damage to your skin and increase your risk of cancer, so to say that you don't require sunscreen is **you** not facing reality. I'm not sure why your response is so hostile, I was never trying to push anything on you, just making a suggestion. Do you also not shampoo or use soap? I mean, those aren't exactly ""natural,"" but they sure do help with keeping clean."

I think it had to do with the daughter and boyfriend fighting, and the girl would feign a fainting spell.

But the dramatic entrance and the mom yelling at me and trying to get me fired I will never forget.
