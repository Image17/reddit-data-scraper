1601865911.0|aww|karaokeoverkill|In Europe. Went to uni in Scotland and I was shocked at the lack of screens, especially because I had a nest of very large spiders right outside one of my windows.
1601865908.0|aww|Kalooeh|"I had a Skookum, which is a Munchkin and a La Perm mix. Guy lived to be 18 years. Biggest health problem was he couldn't have cat food with grain in it and that's not even an uncommon problem with cats in general. Really he had no mobility issues and he even one managed to rebound off the couch and right over my head onto a chair, then take off through the house during a zoomies. Often up in one of the cat trees, on the back off the couch, of jumping up onto places with the other cats. 

Outweighed all the other cats too and Rocko was solid as hell with all the muscle to him. With his size, and short front legs and long hair he actually looked somewhat like a raccoon because just this stocky weird shaped cat. Didn't growl either, just made a huffing noise at the other cats (like hffhffhffhfffhff)

No problems with his back or legs. I had a regular cat that's back kind of sank as she aged but her AND her brother also ended up with sinus and mouth/throat cancer, along with other health problems. 

The thing is that Munchkins have been confirmed to not have specific health problems that aren't really breed specific since other breeds can have health conditions show up like with their backs, but people keep clinging to the old shit from people like Peta and the Dodo that because they have this look that they must be unhealthy.

The biggest problem for the breed really is the gene for it is dominant and can't breed two short-dominants together.

1601865895.0|aww|RiposteHatesYou|"Dachshunds have an extended back though, corgis do not. The issue comes from increased impact from the short legs, but has nothing to do with their actual spine. However, as long as you take care of your corgis and don't let them jump from high places, they are fine. I've got 2 of them. 

I agree that breeds that have horrible health problems right from the get go, like bulldogs can barely breathe right from birth. I think ""tea cup"" versions are the worst though, and are normally straight from inbreeding. Anyone who buys a tea cup Chihuahua is an asshole as far as I'm concerned."
1601865894.0|aww|stringbean96|Just assuming here, but since it says Rangers, they might be on a nature preserve? They might be watching the elephants closely and notice the young one got away.

https://www.handicappedpets.com/blog/ivdd-in-dogs/

My statement wasn't meant to disparage corgis, but to say that short-legged dogs are definitely prone to certain illnesses. Dachshunds are the prime example of this.

I don't know about incidence of disease (of any kind) in corgis. I do think that when 1/4 of dogs is experiencing a certain problem (like dachshunds) you should seriously reconsider the continuation of the breed, especially when the traits causing the problem are largely present for the sake of aesthetics. (Dachshunds aren't actually hunting badgers any more.)

Personally, I think it would be nice if everyone stopped breeding dogs... but I understand that that's not really reasonable and that not all dog breeds are equally as unethical. Bulldogs, dachshunds, and cavalier spaniels are the worst offenders as far as I know."

English bull terrier: 100 years ago they looked normal, but now we recognize their egg shaped noses. This may cause problems for the health as well

Dogs make them feel more safe and allow them to be more relaxed because they take cues from the dog.

The dachshunds you see today are the same as the ones that were hunting badgers. As I said in another comment, 20-25% of dachshunds develop IVDD, which leads to very painful spinal problems and possible paralysis. I highly doubt that was the case when they were still a working dog.

I'll also mention that I recently adopted (what appears to be) a dachshund mix from the local shelter. She's a wonderful animal, but I can't imagine why someone would support the continuation of a breed with such common, severe, and painful problems."

1601863252.0|aww|anassakata|"The image is from a licensed wildlife rehabber in upstate NY who goes by fuzzyfawnwildlife on Instagram. She rescues fawns from a variety of situations over the course of the spring and summer (stuck in a fence, mom hit by a car, improperly 'rescued' by people) and provides care for them at her barn. She is required to release them in the fall except late birthed fawns so she tranqs them and moves them to a more secluded area near her friend's property so they have a good chance of avoiding people and don't come back to her barn, and releases them together so they'll have a better chance of getting through the winter. This was her most recent release, I believe.

She has a few fawns she's been allowed to 'winter over', including one who's basically BFFs with a rabbit she nursed back to health. I've learned a lot from her posts about how to treat wildlife, and frankly a lot about how much time and effort is involved. She does a full-time job of this and doesn't get paid. A very cool lady."

Source: i have severe ADHD and i get overstimulated quite easily. I also called you a jackass because you’re an insulting person, not because of your information. You’ve quite literally only been insulting me and others throughout this entire thread. You’ve called many others and me ignorant, dumbasses, idiots, as well as more. As i said. You’re being downvoted because you’re *rude.* Not to mention that the article you posted isn’t correct nor does it have proper sources. Tickling allows a developing body to garner some sense of space, where their body is as well as more. It’s the reason why throwing your kid 10 feet into a lake is enjoyable and fun.

My pets and purse, of course; then I packed a suitcase with some clothing, toiletries/meds, my laptop and iPad + chargers. Also put my jewelry box and viola by the suitcase, if there was room for them too.

Don’t have insurance since I’m a renter... it’s possible my renter’s insurance is still active, since it was tied to my auto insurance, but I haven’t checked in a while. Probably should do that. But it doesn’t cover much, and making claims on individual items is complicated. Learned that after a small flood in my old apartment! I mean, who keeps paper receipts for every item they own? Not me."

The munchkin gene is dominant, so breeding them at all - inbred or not - has the same effect of creating more cats with harmful genetic defects just because we find it cute.

So yeah, to be precise inbreeding isn't the issue here but it has the exact same outcome as inbreeding pets for these kinds of traits."

What can I say. Hes a stud and likes them bitches (and the air..?) as much as they love him. I'm certainly not in any position to judge anyways...

1601861140.0|aww|zachzsg|Fawns operate differently than adult deer. It’s very common in the wild for the mother to just leave a fawn in a spot for hours at a time, and they evolutionarily know not to move basically no matter what. Deer are also pretty dumb, so they’re probably just assuming the rescuer is their mother.
