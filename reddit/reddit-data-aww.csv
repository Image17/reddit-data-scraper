https://www.handicappedpets.com/blog/ivdd-in-dogs/

My statement wasn't meant to disparage corgis, but to say that short-legged dogs are definitely prone to certain illnesses. Dachshunds are the prime example of this.

I don't know about incidence of disease (of any kind) in corgis. I do think that when 1/4 of dogs is experiencing a certain problem (like dachshunds) you should seriously reconsider the continuation of the breed, especially when the traits causing the problem are largely present for the sake of aesthetics. (Dachshunds aren't actually hunting badgers any more.)

Personally, I think it would be nice if everyone stopped breeding dogs... but I understand that that's not really reasonable and that not all dog breeds are equally as unethical. Bulldogs, dachshunds, and cavalier spaniels are the worst offenders as far as I know."

English bull terrier: 100 years ago they looked normal, but now we recognize their egg shaped noses. This may cause problems for the health as well

This species among many others is going extinct because of wildlife trafficking and habitat loss. They’re smart, beautiful, and the vast majority (with zoos and rescues as an exception) belong in the wild."
1601863902.0|aww|redkat30|"The unfortunate thing about that is there are people out there that do breed for the sake of the breed.  Bad breeding leads to many things.  Hip dysplasia is common on most large breeds therefore hard to avoid, just like older people they will get arthritis and break down. 
 I am huge in animal rescue, there are so many that need a home but I also advocate reputable breeding. Without those people who truly love and care for the breed it would not exist."

The dachshunds you see today are the same as the ones that were hunting badgers. As I said in another comment, 20-25% of dachshunds develop IVDD, which leads to very painful spinal problems and possible paralysis. I highly doubt that was the case when they were still a working dog.

I'll also mention that I recently adopted (what appears to be) a dachshund mix from the local shelter. She's a wonderful animal, but I can't imagine why someone would support the continuation of a breed with such common, severe, and painful problems."

1601863252.0|aww|anassakata|"The image is from a licensed wildlife rehabber in upstate NY who goes by fuzzyfawnwildlife on Instagram. She rescues fawns from a variety of situations over the course of the spring and summer (stuck in a fence, mom hit by a car, improperly 'rescued' by people) and provides care for them at her barn. She is required to release them in the fall except late birthed fawns so she tranqs them and moves them to a more secluded area near her friend's property so they have a good chance of avoiding people and don't come back to her barn, and releases them together so they'll have a better chance of getting through the winter. This was her most recent release, I believe.

She has a few fawns she's been allowed to 'winter over', including one who's basically BFFs with a rabbit she nursed back to health. I've learned a lot from her posts about how to treat wildlife, and frankly a lot about how much time and effort is involved. She does a full-time job of this and doesn't get paid. A very cool lady."

1601862684.0|aww|sp1d3_b0y|That’s not a fat fingered mistake, for one. Two, your entire point was *overstimulation*. Which is still easily solvable. Source: i have severe ADHD and i get overstimulated quite easily. I also called you a jackass because you’re an insulting person, not because of your information. You’ve quite literally only been insulting me and others throughout this entire thread. You’ve called many others and me ignorant, dumbasses, idiots, as well as more. As i said. You’re being downvoted because you’re *rude.* Not to mention that the article you posted isn’t correct nor does it have proper sources. Tickling allows a developing body to garner some sense of space, where their body is as well as more. It’s the reason why throwing your kid 10 feet into a lake is enjoyable and fun. Tickle torture was used for extended periods of time and with much more painful things than fingers.

My pets and purse, of course; then I packed a suitcase with some clothing, toiletries/meds, my laptop and iPad + chargers. Also put my jewelry box and viola by the suitcase, if there was room for them too.

Don’t have insurance since I’m a renter... it’s possible my renter’s insurance is still active, since it was tied to my auto insurance, but I haven’t checked in a while. Probably should do that. But it doesn’t cover much, and making claims on individual items is complicated. Learned that after a small flood in my old apartment! I mean, who keeps paper receipts for every item they own? Not me."

The munchkin gene is dominant, so breeding them at all - inbred or not - has the same effect of creating more cats with harmful genetic defects just because we find it cute.

So yeah, to be precise inbreeding isn't the issue here but it has the exact same outcome as inbreeding pets for these kinds of traits."

It’s very common in the wild for the mother to just leave a fawn in a spot for hours at a time, and they evolutionarily know not to move basically no matter what. Deer are also pretty dumb, so they’re probably just assuming the rescuer is their mother.

I mean, as far as I know, it started like this.

but then human idiots thought that it is cute and bred these so-called munchkin cats on purpose. creating cats that lose so much mobility and vitality. and have serious health issues.

and people who think that this is cute are actively looking for this breed and create a demand. 

and now the munchkin cat is an official breed

yeay..."
