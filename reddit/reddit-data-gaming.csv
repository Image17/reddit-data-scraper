Of course, the Game Pass library is big, so there's a variety of games to play, but, honestly, I don't even have time for all the games on Stadia at the moment.

It's a drive-in chain throughout the United States, and I think Canada. A drive-in is different from a drive-through in that you park in a spot and the food is brought out to your car instead of you pulling up to a window. You order over an intercom you initiate with a red button.

They used to wear roller skates, but they don't anymore.

They sell products in these categories: burgers, chicken, hot dog, ice cream, drink fountain, custom drinks, milkshakes, bagged ice, and gallon tea. They also default to take tots instead of french fries, and their tots are better than their fries. They also have onion rings.

Their commercials are stupid, typically with two guys in a parking spot waiting on their food and saying moronic things. [here you go.](https://youtu.be/yV7B3XyrfGs)

I still stand by what I said about disagreement. I think a discussion can be had with anyone even if there is a disagreement because it gives you insight into how the other person thinks. And that is infinitely better than 'agreeing to disagree' or anything else, imo. 

I was in your spot a few years back when the pronoun debacle was in the limelight. My mum's an English teacher and so grammar was knocked into my head from an early age. And my native language has a similar situation to English with no gender neutral pronouns. 

I hope my comments help you understand why people seem to refuse to budge on the usage of 'they' and I do hope I didn't seem patronising or sanctimonious in my comments.

As long as a guard didn't see you do it, the residents of the home wouldn't even speak up about it. And then, if you did get seen by the guards, they level scale so high that it is functionally completely impossible to beat them, regardless of how strong you are.

Mania is Classic so that doesn't count. Forces.... was a stumbling point, I'll admit, but still, it's not awful.

1601863758.0|gaming|HobbesTech|"I'M SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS!! Ever since the original mountain update where they made it so biomes can change on the vertical axis, I have been desperately hoping for this day to come. Sure it doesn't have everything I've been wanting, but this is still something to finally get me interested again!! 

What I had truly wanted was additional depth, a few more tiers of metals interspersed (along with maybe a higher ceiling and lower floor of ability/speed?), and much more unique and varied generation. If it was a lot deeper, the generation could even vary a lot more at the different depths. That would all truly make me jump back in.

Why is this important to me? Well, essentially all I do in minecraft is mine. I build a little house, I farm, I get animals, I go to the nether, sure. But 90% of my time is spent down in the mines, exploring caves, gathering materials, making little rest points. It's what is most fun to me. And sadly that loop hasn't changed almost at all since the day I started playing. Sure the underground generation changed a little once or twice, but that's it. In fact, a number of additions, such as hunger, actually made it worse, since it required me to not stay down as long, it interrupted my favorite part. Hence why I stopped right before hunger was added.

For the past few years I've mused jumping back into Minecraft, but the lack of anything meaningful (or at all) changing to what I like has prevented me. Now though?

Now with that change, now I (well, soon at least) will actually have to."

So, if you go digital, then the game will be fully downloaded over the Internet, but if you get the disc version, then the content on the disc will be downloaded to the PlayStation and then whatever isn’t on the disc will be downloaded from the internet.

I prefer the disc version so I have access to more sales."

1601861499.0|gaming|densetsu86|"Well if he prefers playstation then you get him a ps5. 

I see people keep arguing for gamepass. While its (for now) good for players, Sony has a compelling enough competition to that. Psnow. 9.99 a month or $60 for the year. Add that

Psnow yearly + Ps+ yearly = 120. So 120 vs 180 from game pass. That's $60 cheaper and you get psnow for pc and playstation with ps+. Ps+ on ps5 gives you instant game collection and ps+ collection. 

Psnow is 1 price and includes the service for playstation and pc. For pc it's all streaming. For playstation you can stream or download. You also get access to 800+ games. Those games include ps2 on ps4 which can be downloaded or streamed. Ps3 which is streaming only. Ps4 which can both be streamed or downloaded.

Now current ps now does not support mobile device (there is no mention that this will not or will happen sometime down the road, it's just currently ps and pc). 

And the other difference is no day 1 games. 

So psnow has 800+ vs gamepass 300+. 

Psnow with ps+ is 120 yearly vs gamepass 180 a year.

Psnow no day 1 vs gamepass some day 1

Pc and ps included vs more expensive option only for pc and xbox.

Psnow can stream games to the playstation vs gamepass cannot stream to xbox. All games must be downloaded on xbox so you need the space.

Also psnow streaming is on par with gamepass. Since they both use azure. 

Psnow is in 19 countries and gamepass with streaming is in 22 without streaming in 46.

So both have their pros and cons. Both are good deals with amazing values."
