I would draw the line to only prohibit identity-based criticism that's directed at a specific person.  For example, saying ""Islam is a stupid religion"" should be fine, but not saying ""you're a stupid muslim"".  A particular identity should never be the determining factor.  It should only matter whether or not someone is attacked directly, regardless of what they are attacked for."

You said it was ""when one puts their own race first"". That's not supremacy. Hording power? Okay, maybe. But not caring more about your own race than other people. For example, if you had two buttons in front of you and you were forced to press one, one killed 10 Indians and the other killed 10 white people (or whatever you are), you would obviously press the latter. 

It is not supremacy for *any race* to care more about their own more than others. That's just kinship. Supremacy is thinking you are superior to all in virtually every aspect, which I know white people are not (i.e. eastern Asians have a higher IQ)"

I agree about the tribalism; the problem is that we don't understand quite how human consciousness looks like or what the data we're basing our truths off of comes from.                

It is absolutely supremacy when one group hordes all the power.

1599331285.0|announcements|TheGeorgiaGazette|"I've been addicted to this thread for the last 6 hours straight.   


I own a large news organization in the state of Georgia. We run (ran) 25 Facebook pages, one for each county we cover. We mainly focus on crime, posting mugshots, police reports, body cam footage, court records, etc.   


We were up to about 400 posts per day, spread out across all of our pages, when Facebook started disabling our admin accounts for ""posting too much"", regardless of how much our followers enjoyed the content.  


I made the difficult decision to transition all pages (and future pages) to Reddit. I found out quickly that I could only create so many subreddits at a time - I'm currently in ""Subreddit jail"" for the next 3 days ;)   


However, reading this thread gives me hope that moving to Reddit will ultimately be the right choice. I invested a lot into Facebook, and it's really sad what they have become, but my followers and I agree that this is the right decision. Thank you, u/spez, for being so vocal - regardless of whether the response is positive or not.   


My one major disappointment is that I can't seem to target cities using Reddit Ads. I can only target the state as a whole. There are a lot of areas we don't cover, and I feel like targeting the entire state wouldn't be very cost-effective.

Well, I understand that you need money. Instead of making different awards you can improve Gold and Platinum ones.

* Mod's effectively acting as censors on subs such as Israel, Iran, Conservatives
* Creating sufficiently vague rules that Mods can interpret them as they see fit to ban posters. The rules need to be ironclad specific and not selectively enforced.
* There is no 3 strikes and you're out policy. It is simply one and done based on the Moderators point of view or mood when banning
* The deliberate attempt to create a sort of echo-chamber where differing points of views are purposely removed on technicalities
* In the case of /Iran sub, it is actually state backed propaganda being pushed
* There is no effective oversight of the Mods who have unlimited power and discretion
* There is no means for voting or selecting the mods or rules by members of the community. Its dictated to us. 

The platform needs rules for Moderators and efforts to protect free, polite but dissenting speech. It does not do that to the public's detriment."

I'm not ""left"" or ""right"". I agree and disagree with things from both sides. I cherry pick because I have my own mind. No one will put me in a box. Leftists hate me because I hate the victim mentality and I'm honest, those from the right hate me because I don't believe in god or care about being a traditional family man. 

However, there is one thing about the right that I like that the left doesn't have, and that is: most of the time you can have a discussion with them without getting cancelled, censored, insulted or dehumanized. Almost all the time you try this with the left... well, you're just not considered a human with feelings anymore. You're a monster, your life should be ruined, hate, hate hate. No good intentions to be seen towards another fellow human.

Censoring is truly the easiest way of winning. No one can call you out if they can't speak, right? If you think someone is wrong let them speak and make an idiot of themselves. Believing you are the arbiter of truth is the ultimate form of arrogance. 

The excuse of ""hate speech"" will never work. First, because I am convinced people from both sides spewed hate. So you should then ban a lot more leftist subreddits, including the leftist equivalent of The_Donald. Second, there will always be people who feel offended by what someone says. The only question is how many. And to base morality on numbers is really not moral."

My stance is that only an individual themselves has the right to decide whether or not they grant another person consent, yet. Radical, I know, but it's understandable you'd have that reaction given the many times you've established how little you think of a woman's cognitive capabilities.

> ""Some women really like to be raped, meaning that although she is consenting and therefore is not really a rape, everything else is exactly the same : the guy wants to rape her, she struggles, he does it anyway, he thinks he raped her, but she actually loved it. It's her kink, she thinks that since he risked prison to rape her, he really must have wanted her, which is exactly what she wants and her wants are very valid"".

This has nothing to do with what I said. A woman can be capable of giving consent without it meaning that *any time* she engages in sexual activity it is consensual. If a woman doesn't want to have sex there is no consent, plain and simple. If a man has sex with a woman that is protesting - verbally or physically - or that hasn't granted him consent then that is rape, there is no presumed consent that comes with a woman being capable of giving consent.

For example, we recognize that children aren't capable of consenting to sex. If a 30 year old man rapes a 10 year old girl even if she said it was okay that doesn't mean it was - this is because the child lacks the proper understanding of the weight of the decision she is making, she isn't aware of the possible ramifications for her decision, and because the man as an adult is in a position of power to manipulate and expose the child's vulnerability. A 30 year old woman is capable of giving consent to that same 30 year old man, but she is just as capable of revoking consent. Her simply having the mental capacity and understanding to grant consent does not mean it's always granted. She can choose not to give consent or withdraw consent at any moment for any reason and if the man refuses to obey he is raping her.

You're being incredibly disingenuous with this argument.

> So even if we were to believe such prostitutes exist, since you cannot prove that a prostitute really wants to have sex with the old man as the difference between A and B all resides in her head, **we cannot simply take her word for it**

This is a problem that only you are having and I'm not going to hold your hand through it simply because you refuse to trust women or think them capable of the cognitive ability required with giving consent. If we cannot simply take a woman's word for it when she grants consent than women are untrustworthy creatures incapable of deciphering their own wants and motivations, so how can we trust her word when she doesn't grant consent anymore? Clearly the solution is to just ignore a woman's consent all together. This is what you're arguing in favor for. How about we just trust women with our own bodies and decisions and allow us to consent with or revoke consent from whoever we so choose for whatever reason we deem fit? This is the same respect we give men.

> I clearly hate women and my ""fixation"" on them has nothing to do with the discussion of the closing of the 1st feminist sub,

If you're referring to gender critical I don't consider any sub that stands to demonize and target one of the most vulnerable groups of women today as feminist, but clearly our opinion on what is feminist differs very much since yours is dependent upon taking away women's rights and mine is dependent upon empowering women to be and do what they want without pressure from any external systems.

The fact that you screenshot a picture of me arguing in favor of women's consent as the catalyst for this outrage is illustrative of your entire problem - women's right to choose and govern our own bodies.

If I want to have sex with someone I will. If I don't I won't. That's it. I'm sorry you're so upset by my bodily autonomy but I'll leave that to you to figure out on your own since this conversation is far beyond the point of being productive and it's not worth discussing it with you further."

1597687198.0|announcements|sinekonata|"So to you the money is what guarantees that you want to make it. And the more they pay, the more you feel it's appreciated and the more you want to make the ""gift"".

Meaning there's no way of differentiating your situation (A.) from that of a person who just hates making the object but makes it for the money (B.). That's very clever and convenient. I guess the equivalent of your paid rape apologist argument for unpaid rape apologists would be :   
""Some women really like to be raped, meaning that although she is consenting and therefore is not really a rape, everything else is exactly the same : the guy wants to rape her, she struggles, he does it anyway, he thinks he raped her, but she actually loved it. It's her kink, she thinks that since he risked prison to rape her, he really must have wanted her, which is exactly what she wants and her wants are very valid"".

Out of precaution, to avoid raping women, we don't start by assuming that there might be a chance that she loves it but still needs to be coerced into it, or that coercion is exactly what makes them feel appreciated.

So even if we were to believe such prostitutes exist, since you cannot prove that a prostitute really wants to have sex with the old man as the difference between A and B all resides in her head, we cannot simply take her word for it and might as well suppose, out of caution to prevent rape, that, as most of them say, they do it because they need the sustenance and wouldn't let the old guy rape them otherwise.

You're the one who needs to rethink its liberal individualistic cowardly views. I was never talking of individuals and their ""valid experiences"", I'm talking systemically. So yes, in a world without oppression/coercion, we would not be having this discussion, I don't care what women do with their bodies as long as they're not coerced into it, which today they clearly are, and you're still defending their rapists, you horrible cowardly traitor.

\> your hyper fixation on *women* and *our* financial exchanges makes me doubtful of the sincerity of your argument here  
Sure, I'm actually a misogynist, I clearly hate women and my ""fixation"" on them has nothing to do with the discussion of the closing of the 1st feminist sub, only with controlling women like a good patriarch. STFU, enough of your rape apologist women traitor pimping.

You do realise preventing ""hate speech"" means no longer supporting free speech, right? You can do one or the other (hopefully free speech), but not both, and ""prevention"" in this context is really nothing but censorship.

Further, there's no definition of what ""hate speech"" is - it's a loose blanket term, and the words and phrases it covers can easily expand over time since not everyone is ""offended"" by the same things. Therefore, choosing to ban ""hate speech"" just isn't a viable option, since people will be blindsided and punished for something they and many others would consider harmless but the loud minority consider ""offensive""."

The Senior Editor

We have multiple confirmations that a vaccine for COVID 19 not only exists but has existed for some time, since 2019, perhaps as early as 2017.

John Hankey reports that Trump and his inner circle were vaccinated in November 2019, only days after the virus was deployed.

Months ago, VT traced the creation of the current versions of COVID 19/SARS COV 2 to a USAID-CIA funded and peer reviewed study done by the University of North Carolina by scientists closely aligned with America‚Äôs defense community.

We are also told that COVID 19, as VT reported in March, was deployed against China, then Italy, then France, then Iran and Spain and then the US as a ‚Äúfund raiser.‚Äù

COVID 19 is the ultimate ‚Äúsanction‚Äù and ultimate tool to bring about that ‚ÄúNew World Order‚Äù we have been hearing about.  Now we see it as a reality.

1597181119.0|announcements|Torboy007|This was exactly what I thought- And how do we know that Reddit isn't in bed with the DNC in terms of Donations? I think Reddit should have to publicly disclose it's finances, including IRS tax returns, as well as the IRS Tax Returns of all of it's employees,  in order to be allowed to have ads of any kind on its platform AT ALL.
1597179770.0|announcements|Torboy007|The problem i see with this is that this kind of policy is election tampering in and of itself, especially if Reddit, Inc. ever made a single political campaign contribution to a member of either political party.- which would mean that Reddit then must effectively recuse itself of administering political ads at all (instead leaving it to disinterested third parties that haven't made campaign contributions of any kind to either party)  because such would be a conflict of interest.
1597178425.0|announcements|Torboy007|"The problem I see with this is that there needs to be made a clear distinction in the rule that makes the distinction between something that attacks someone's values, and something that promotes hate. For example- The fact that someone doesn't accept homosexuality does not make them ""anti-gay"" in the slightest.  Otherwise, we're headed for the same ruins that Facebook is becoming, with moderation getting more tied up in fee-fees versus demonstrating actual clear-cut rule violations. 

It also needs to be made clear that the rules are a two-way street and there needs to be consistent, swift, and extremely severe enforcement against the moderators on some of the more liberal subs that are consistently violating the moderator guidelines."

tldr: helped codify RSS, assisted in Markdown's development, web.py's development, helped organize Creative Commons, and was one of the first real and effective online activists, assisting groups like Fight For the Future to fight bills that restrict and hurt the Internet and raise awareness through quality web design and informative videos.

He was caught downloading JSTOR articles and they gathered some charges on him. He hanged himself -- allegedly -- before it could go to trial.

The Internet and the world lost a bright soul, for setting free information that every American paid for through their taxes or through inflated prices at market.

1596681330.0|announcements|HTPDon1947|"Hidden Treasure Productions began in January of this year with the same high hopes that many other endeavors had. Don‚Äôt get me wrong! We still have high hopes and are going forward with the great desire to be successful! However, the onset of Coronavirus has caused us to be creative. Fortunately for us, our company is made up of ‚Äúcreative types!‚Äù 

Early on, the decision was made to hold all auditions and rehearsals online through Zoom Technology. That has worked out surprisingly well. We had also planned to start meeting as a live cast in early August. The Jury is still out on that one, but we are hopeful that we will soon be able to rehearse outside in someone‚Äôs back yard in groups of less than 10. Living in a nice climate allows us to do that, even in the autumn months.¬† 

We currently have a perfect venue booked for October 9-11, 2020. However, if we must change the dates to early November, due to CDC gatherings restrictions, then that is what we‚Äôll do. We must all be adaptive in this new world we are living in today! Our Director, Valerie Herrera, has put together a stellar cast. Many of the performers are professional actors and have extensive resumes.¬†

Make plans to come out to see ‚ÄúShadows of the Mind‚Äù in downtown Oceanside, California. The definite dates will be forthcoming and will be posted on the Hidden Treasure Productions website.  [https://hiddentreasureproductions.org](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/5464046714808358737/6752820149591034478#)

Our ultimate goal is to take our production internationally in the Spring of 2021, either to the U.K. or to Ukraine. Plans are still underway to accomplish this. All of this to say, ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt no COVID gonna‚Äô keep us down!‚Äù

No, I ignored the irrelevant wrong thing that wasn't important, and fixed your incorrect statement to make actual sense. This is not 'cherry picking' anything; I'm correcting your incorrect statements, because you really don't comprehend what you're talking about, and you're conflating discrete concepts, and you don't even know that you're using the wrong ""logical argument terminology"" words. 

> giving more of your contact info to a site is more of a privacy risk. This is not complicated arithmetic.

Then what's *my* email? 

The email doesn't exist in a vacuum, ***but it's not fucking relevant because Reddit does nothing at all with that email beyond verification of the account holder.*** They do not contact you with it, and nothing on Reddit can connect to it to use it for identification in any way. My verified username doesn't personally identify me in any manner beyond to that username; my spam mail isn't showing up on Reddit feeds, and my Reddit comments don't affect my spam mail. They are insulated by a metaphorical vacuum because there's no connection between them. And guess what? Using the email address to send confirmation of the username *still doesn't add any connection between those two things.* Neither does using my device's camera to pull an algorithm from a QR code which has been associated to my username.

Factually, it *protects* your privacy, because it gives you a method to verify your credentials (which, if you recall, are made up by you yourself in the first place, because you choose your own username and password) without having to use your email address. If it sent you an email every time to make sure it was still you, then anyone looking over your shoulder while you do it can get your username, can't they?"

You mean, ""In other words, your anonymous email is literally and exactly that, and two-factor authentication using it is not personally identifiable."" Which was my exact and explicit point. The fact that your typing style is traceable through anything that you write is not relevant to that fact. The fact that your IP can be used to track your shopping habits is also not relevant to that fact. The fact that the email address can be on a list somewhere is not relevant, because it isn't visibly attached to your Reddit username unless you make a post about how your username uses that email address.

I've seen other users with the same problem but here's one no one said i believe. the camera roll is awful. I can't even choose what folder i wanna search for. it's not even in recent order, it's in alphabetical order of my folders. so if i want to post a picture, i gotta move them to my folder that starts by X because that's the first one appearing.

This like multiples their work load 20 times, instead of being able to just look at something now they gotta go through 20 images, imagine if someone got like 3 or four people to spam a subreddit with like albums that had like a single pic of a decapitated head in the middle or something, the mods would probably either be overwhelmed or have to institute really strict rules.

For example looking at this post on the website Vs on the android app 

Within the website I see the full image top to bottom and left to right. 

On the current official android app the image is cropped to a square aspect ratio cutting off part of the bottom of the image and some off the sides. 

While for this image on this post it's not a huge problem, subs with images including text screenshots for example up to half the image is missing. Makes reading text based image posts very difficult. You loose detail on portrait images where parts are cut off. 


Thanks.

1601852720.0|AskReddit|whatisliquidity|"That's not how communism or socialism functions.

If you're talking about living in some small commune in the middle of nowhere where 50 people or so manage then do that. Bc it's irrelevant and frankly it's still capitalism.

Socialism requires moral guidance to be regulated in and enforced. It stifles innovation bc no one has the motivation to create bc incentive is lacking.

Being compensated for a skill set is moral. The more specialized and in demand your skills the more value you can demand.

There's a reason socialism has never succeeded. Not only has it failed repeatedly, Venezuela being there best illustration of it's failure, it's had catastrophic consequences."

Cause there are a few spots i could put it inside something that won't come apart or be accessible without serious effort if you do realize it.

For example there is an odd metal spot where there used to be an ac mount. I could probably hide it inside the mounting post hole. The tube seems hollow. Toss some glue on the clip to prevent rattling if detective pulled it off the wall. Of all the places to hide it, I could easily do this without disturbing the dust and then just spend the next 4 minutes making false leads in spots in the storage room etc."

The 4 HS kids were 3 guys and one girl. Two or the guys started arguing because guy 1 said he slept with guy 2 gf. Who was the girl in the group. Finally girl gets mad and screams at her bf that it's true she had sex with the other guy and she's sick of hearing about it. She storms off and the 2 guys start a fist fight. Third guy is over it and walks away. Entire cafeteria loses its shit. People start standing on tables to see. 2 teachers are trying and failing to break up the fight. Everyone is either trying to eat or cheering them on. Someone grabs the football coach who breaks up the fight. Cops are called. Lunch goes an hour late. It was fun until the assembly later that day where it turns out there would be consequences.

Try to get your friends and family to set you up on dates, maybe. I've been set up with some women I liked. Just too shy to actually talk, unless I drink and I don't meet women that like to drink very often (I don't blame them). Seems like you've had enough of being single and for people like us it doesn't just magically get better, especially when times are tough (losing a loved one or a close friend).

I was thinking more about those ""light"" examples. Bcs day in day out I see a lot of ppl who are trying to ""blame"" on depresion and anxiety over their laziness and incompetence to give a little bit of effort in their life. 
!! People who are ill are ill and thats not something to question !!
I've been through 2-3 mayor depresion periods in my life, but last suicide toughts was when i was 12-15 yrs old, and that was before any of those periods. After last depresion period ( around 3-5 yrs ago ) I told my self that I dont want to live like that never again, and I'm trying every day to change harmfull toughts and to change POV in my head to make it more friendly and positive enviroment. Sounds easy but its not. 
My best friend had some suicide toughts and he needed professional help bcs he was unable to handle it alone. Thank god he is fine right now.
Also I'm happy about you, and that you are still here so we can exchange some words :) 
I understand that there are some things which you cannot change that are playing big part in our brain games. Thats why I was talking about those things which you can change and make your life easier. 
Hope that I've maded it more clear what I had in mind, I know life its not easy, and everyone has their own daily struggles which we know nothing about. And even a professional help is not helpfull if you dont let it help you."

1601852573.0|AskReddit|PlasticStress6|"IDK if this fits here, but it's a funny story

My mom is a nurse and one time she was vibing with a patient while they waited for the doctor, and she asked to use the bathroom. My mom said yes and didn't think too much of it. When the patient came back, she smelled like hair burning in a dumpster. Again, didn't think too much of it. She had to make a call, so she went outside, not ready for what awaited her.

When she got out, there was legit a trail of human shit (I wish I was making this up) that lead to the bathrooms upstairs. Also, before you ask, she didn't have severe diarrhea, I guess she realized it too late. The crazy thing about this story is she acted like this was a routine thing she did, which raises questions that I don't want answered."

It's an ugly piece of meat that was created(not really but it became popular) durring the time of communism when people struggled with food so they created this piece of shit. It's basically some ground meat mixxed with whatever you find in your fridge.

That's it, and somehow every pole eats it at some point in their life. Oh and also you fry it after you coat it with something most often just grinded dried bread. 

And for some reason it tastes good.

I'm not suggesting a solution, but a way to help you feel better about yourself. Remember that you are worthy. You are alive and the world is a big place. Have courage to explore different places and meet different people. Change takes time. Be active, even if its just walking. Helping others may help you. Believe that you have a right to be in this world. Be kind to yourself.

I woke up the next day and attended an online AA meeting and decided I would go to my sister's for two months before we made that decision. Afterwards, we both took 50% blame and I came home and we are civically working things out. I am regaining my identity and coming to terms with our 20 year marriage.

1601852423.0|AskReddit|MyShixteenthAccount|"I don't really know what ""tear a whole in the continuum"" means but given current known physics there are a few straightforward ways of time travel.

All of them appear *impractical* and many physicists think they, for various reasons, are actually impossible.  But this is an unknown at the moment.

Wormholes are pretty simple. 

1) make a wormhole 

2) drag one end around near the speed of light 

3) The ends of the wormhole are now at different times

Now, it looks like there's not way to do this without the whole thing collapsing catastrophically, (especially if it's larger than particle sized), but we don't *know* that it wouldn't work.

There is no ""be the fulcrum.""  You just can't do that.

""Dimension hopping"" could actually be a thing in two senses.  First, under certain descriptions, there are paths into and then out of black holes but they're one way trips into what might be ""other dimensions.""  There isn't anything that could survive the journey...even in principle.  But maybe we discover some new physics that allows for some sort of shielding?

The more run of the mill (fits with currently understood physics) method would be to just go to sleep for an indefinite amount of time and wait for the universe to repeat.  If you assume the universe is infinite in time then, eventually there will be spontaneous big bang like events producing ""new universes.""  This would require you to go into some sort of stasis (computer upload?) for unfathomable amounts of time.  But then, you just wait until things are how you want them and then wake up.

If it's actually possible to time travel it's probably more like ""turning to the right"" in the sense of - you just need to go the other direction in time (which, really, is what the wormhole is).  It's not exciting - you just go a direction which just happens to be backwards in time.  Likely this would require exceedingly unusual circumstances and huge amounts of energy since it doesn't appear to happen naturally with any frequency.

So, basically, current known physics does not preclude time travel.  Not at all really aside from *possibly* requiring extremely large amounts of energy.

Though, again, I think time travel is precluding prior to physics but that's another discussion."

1601852488.0|aww|CaptainNoBoat|"Right, they weren't selectively bred, but they are still being intentionally bred to sell, and their numbers are increasing rapidly.

Partly because of websites like this, where millions of people see them, think ""stubby legs are cute,"" despite the health effects and lack of functionality, and the demand increases.

If that's what people want, so be it. I'll just never understand it myself. 

It's like if a dog breed had a genetic mutation to have tiny feet that made it harder to walk, run, jump, etc, and led to osteoarthritis, but everyone found it ""cute,"" so they began to be intentionally bred. It's just a weird thing to perpetuate."

1601852016.0|aww|hedonismbot89|The gene that results in the munchkin traits is a dominant gene, not a recessive gene. It‚Äôs a heterozygous gene (meaning 1 gene is dominant & 1 is recessive) because embryos with 2 copies of the munchkin gene aren‚Äôt viable. That‚Äôs why when two munchkins are bred together they have smaller than normal litter sizes. They literally cannot be inbred to select for the munchkin characteristics. I agree that it‚Äôs not something we should encourage overall. I‚Äôm sure that there are some health issues like back problems, but it wasn‚Äôt a trait humans specifically bred the cats over multiple generations to achieve like a pug or a bulldog. The first **confirmed** cat that gave birth to a munchkin kitten was found underneath a truck in Louisiana in the 1970‚Äôs. Humans had nothing to do with this trait showing up.

1601851278.0|aww|Dragonsandman|"Back in the 70s and 80s there was a popular kids show in Japan where the main characters were a little kid and his pet Raccoon, which led to a bunch of people in Japan getting Raccoons imported from North America as pets. And when the Raccoons did Raccoon things, people realized they were just about the worst pets imaginable, and released them into the wild.

As you might imagine, a sudden influx of a *very* adaptable omnivorous animal into an ecosystem that previously had nothing like them led to some problems."

1601851215.0|aww|hedonismbot89|The gene that results in the munchkin traits is a dominant gene, not a recessive gene. It‚Äôs a heterozygous gene (meaning 1 gene is dominant & 1 is recessive) because embryos with 2 copies of the munchkin gene aren‚Äôt viable. That‚Äôs why when two munchkins are bred together they have smaller than normal litter sizes. They literally cannot be inbred to select for the munchkin characteristics. I agree that it‚Äôs not something we should encourage overall. I‚Äôm sure that there are some health issues like back problems, but it wasn‚Äôt a trait humans specifically bred the cats over multiple generations to achieve like a pug or a bulldog. The first **confirmed** cat that gave birth to a munchkin kitten was found underneath a truck in Louisiana in the 1970‚Äôs. Humans had nothing to do with this trait showing up.

Can't let a puppy run around the house unsupervised unless you have literally no possessions you don't want being chewed to pieces. Crate training is when you get them used to the cage. They naturally like small little cubby holes, you just have to convince them to want that one.

 Once they are older there is little to no need for the cage. A lot of dog owners keep the cage though as a bedroom for the dog. Once they're used to it it's not a cage, it's a private safe spot. Like a bedroom."

Some wild animals can be ""Okay"" as pets with a LOT of attention, but event the most well behaved will start to act out, sometimes dangerously, if they aren't getting adequate attention and stimulation.

Also illegal pet trades are horrible for wild populations. For a lot of ""exotic pets"" the pet trade is one of the leading causes of them being endangered.

My highschool best friend's family fostered one for a while, they're not sure where it came from but was found half frozen on the front porch. It would climb all over your body in a frenzy like you were a tree. Was a loud little thing but her mom thought the squirrel read at least 3 years old. Once it was healthy enough, and the weather was warm again; they let it go outside. It stuck around and they fed it outside but it wouldn't let them touch it anymore once it was outside again. Her mom still leaves food out for it and now the family of squirrels around. They're still loud little things though lol.

one time her dad stomped over and waved his fist yelling at one that was being a bit extra ridiculous when he was trying to explain something to us and it peed all over him. It's still funny. Shut him up fast. He was a good sport about it and laughed too."

1601849998.0|aww|invisiblegiants|"For some people it could be a great benefit, but it‚Äôs not the perfect solution and for some it can be a mistake. With all due respect have you suffered from severe clinical depression? There are times clinically depressed people will struggle to walk or even generally care for a dog. That will leave them feeling like a failure and the dog will suffer for it. People considering a dog need to be realistic about what they can manage. A dog is a living being with its own needs, not a cure or a crutch. It‚Äôs honestly doing people and dogs a disservice not to stress this. 

Anyone wanting a dog needs to take the time to figure out how much time and effort they can put into it. Don‚Äôt just get _____ breed because it‚Äôs beautiful and you are lonely. Know breed characteristics, learn about exercise requirements, and if you get a rescue (and you should) really know what you might be getting into with emotionally rehabilitating an animal that might be traumatized. Don‚Äôt jump in blind and set yourself up for failure because all of our media makes dogs seem like these magical creatures that will bring you nothing but joy and friendship."

She will jump on my back and shoulders whenever I‚Äôm not giving her enough attention and likes to sleep under the covers in my bed. My other cat that I‚Äôve had since she was a kitten doesn‚Äôt bother with either ... 


(Apparently sleeping next to you is a way that cats help to protect themselves. In the wild start cats will often sleep together even though they are not pack animals and will distance themselves from each other during the day. They sleep together as they know it‚Äôs safer and are keeping themselves and others safe. My kitty thinks she‚Äôs keeping me safe while the younger one hunts the spiders round the house and leaves them for me in the morning)"

She seemed a little off with a slight temp and had days where she wouldn't eat. Then we had joint taps done and found pulmonary arthritis which was a relief and started treating it she showed immediate signs of recovery. 

Then yesterday she seemed a bit nauseous so the vet gave us anti nauseous tablets. Thought she would be fine until Monday when we can take her back to the vet. We went away 2.5 hour drive to try enjoy the first holiday we had in 2 years and got a call from our house sitter early that morning saying she had passed away.

Also, she's still too young for chipping yet.  She is probably JUST weaned.  Also, we were home when she flew through our cat door which is too high off the ground for her to have handled under her own steam.  After she came flying in. Immediately went to check the porch in case there were siblings out there as well.  No siblings, but there was a clean brown blanket that doesn't belong to us laying there.  I'm guessing she in it until just before they pitched her in our cat door.

BBC to produce it's programming without advertisements, allowing it to (theoretically) stay free of corporate or private interests influencing it. (allow for example the BBC news to do exposes on companies they may go soft on if they were a major advitiser for example) It also allows BBC programing to have no Ad breaks, which is nice.

Store frozen are a little better for this if you're in a pinch because they can flash freeze their produce, which does less damage.  Personally, though, for something like pico or guac, where the raw ingredients are the star of the show, I'd always chop fresh."

1601850728.0|funny|dthlee|"Yeah. The four wisdom teeth extraction was about 2k, including local anesthesia and a CBCT. The dentist said gas would cost more. Didn't do the gas because it seemed unnecessary, which it was. The root canal and crown was similar in price, but marginally less expensive, IIRC. Might've been the other way around, though. The root canal and crown was around 2k together.

I also saved some money because I had my root canal done in the same visit and the local anesthetic ""overlapped"", in that it was already numb from one procedure, so the dentist was able to use less anesthetic overall than if I had them done in separate visits.

Either way, whether it's gas or local anesthesia, that cost definitely has to be grouped together with the cost of the actual extraction. Dunno about you, but I would never get wisdom teeth extracted without either local anesthesia or gas."

1601850543.0|funny|Meric_|"A.

Equation for bell peppers   f(x) = 20x + 100

Apples = f(x) = x^2 + 10   (Assuming they double the amount they buy per day)

Set the two equations equal to each other.

20x+100 = x^2 +10

x^2 -90=20x

x^2 -20x-90 = 0 

Quadratic Equation and solve. Throw out the negative answer, and get ~23.78. 


A. It will take 24 days for there to be more apples than bell peppers



B. IF the volume of the room is 42.47 cubic meters, that is 42470000 cubic centimeters.

By day 23 (one day before apples outpace peppers) we have 539 apples, and 560 bell peppers.

539 * 180 + 560 * 240 = 231420


B. No, the Apples and bell peppers will not be able to fill the room before the apples out pace



Edit: I just realized that I did the Apple Equation wrong when I relooked at it since I didn't add back the amount of apples they previously had.

Can't be bothered to fix this though, maybe someone else can"

If you feel strongly about it, and found someone of a different race that you fell in love with and decide to marry, only for your grandparents/family to berate and verbally abuse them, then you might think it best to just distance from that person. 

I‚Äôd wager you don‚Äôt feel very strongly about racism, which would explain your views on this topic and why someone would have to be ‚Äúout of their mind,‚Äù or have a mental disorder to distance from someone who genuinely hates and spews hateful things about your husband/wife. Which is ridiculous just so you know. 

You‚Äôre right about me being lucky enough to not have grandparents with those views. But even if you do, and still keep in contact with them regardless of them hurting others you love, it doesn‚Äôt make you right.

All the signage and marketing materials were up for grabs once they were no longer needed, so I got tons of movie posters, even the big 4 panel vinyl window clings.

1601848228.0|funny|RhFpZESmn8Sefni3q3Jb|"I am neither a doctor nor dentist, and you shouldn't rely on this advice.  However:

I have Invisalign as part of a process for implants for congenitally missing teeth in a difficult situation.  As I couldn't have other pontics in place while my teeth were being moved to fit the implants, I had false teeth sitting in the aligners.  It would have been *very* noticeable if I removed them around others, and my bite was different enough without them that eating could be difficult and potentially dangerous for my other teeth (it would have been easy to chip my front teeth).  

As a result, my orthodontist suggested that I try wearing the aligners at essentially all times, including when I ate and drank.  This experiment actually worked pretty well.  The aligners would degrade pretty quickly, but we switched them out every week, and as I wore them for all but a few minutes of every day (when I brushed them, and my teeth), the movement still worked well.  There was some limitation on foods that would be too abrasive, but most foods I ate regularly were alright, despite the definite decrease in tooth sharpness.  I also didn't drink anything *too* hot, but tea and coffee at what I would consider proper temperatures for appreciating them were fine.  There was some staining, but it was manageable.  This was despite my drinking quite a bit of red wine.

The caveats here are that my teeth have otherwise always been excellent, I've never had problems with tooth decay, my diet likely has considerably lower sugar than most people have, I've always had to be careful with foods and dental/orthodontic complexities (the aligners were far less fragile than some non-removable arrangements I had had), and between my dentist, oral surgeon, and orthodontist, my teeth were being looked at quite frequently.  

Now that I have temporary pontics on implants, and I can reasonably eat without the aligners, I do take them out, but I went through two years of wearing them and eating, with no problems.

So in short, despite the recommendations, needing to remove the aligners to eat and drink is a major problem, it may be possible to discuss wearing them at all times with your orthodontist."

1601848146.0|funny|obsolete_filmmaker|ive been to the dentist 4x in the last 6 weeks, and it feels very safe. they have a quiestionaire and temperature taking to enter, theyve upgraded their air system and all the rooms have portable HEPA filters. All the staff has PPE at all times. All patients wear masks, except when you are actually getting worked on. They are only using every other room, so there is a lot of space in the office. It feels completely safe.  The only thing that makes me cautious is the office is on the 25th floor of a busy building, and the elevators to get up there are small.

1601847830.0|funny|terrariapro117|Well look at it from this perspective. Your a cop and you pull someone over, you walk to the car to tell them why they were pulled over. After you ask for ID they reach down for thier waist very fast, the cop has less than a second to decide if the person is a threat. Why would someone reach for anything that fast when your supposed to just keep your hands on the steering wheel. It has happend where a cop pulls someone over and they get shot as soon as they get to the window, or someone draws a gun and tries to shoot them. That's why it's a horrible idea, in a situation like that the brain has a fight or flight response, and in most cases it's a fight response. It's not right but it's not an unreasonable response all things considered.

He walked to the lab trolley that was already there and took a vial of a clear liquid and poured it into a vessel that was sitting in an ice bath.

He took a second vial of a clear liquid and added it the the first and gave it a stir with a glass rod.

He took a third vial of a clear liquid - this one had some viscosity - and he added it tot he ice bath and very carefully stirred it.

He then took a pipette and removed the brown liquid that had formed and put it into a reaction tube.

Took the reaction tube to the nearest sink and dropped it - big bag, tube shattered smoke and....... he said his first words in 5 minutes

Highly recommend the game, you can usually get it cheap on sale or in a bundle because they want you to buy the DLC that adds more civilizations you can play as.  Pretty sure it's available on all consoles now.

It's a fantastic game, you can either play for domination take over the world victory with combat units like I did, or you can go for science victory by being the first person to launch a rocket to another planet, or diplomatic victory by being friends with the whole world until you are elected world leader, or culture victory by having your tourism and works of art and culture influence the world, or religious victory by having your religion take over the world."

1601852426.0|gaming|Doctor-Amazing|"This is so weird to me because I've never heard of anyone doing it with an n64. The top loading cartridges just worked. No blowing required.

The whole thing came about because the NES had this odd mechanism where you slid the cartridge in then pushed it down. Over time the springs wore out and the game didn't make proper contact with the console. This meant that you often had to make sure you had the game in the exact right position to work and you'd end up spending a few minutes nudging it side to side or popping it in out a few times. Blowing on the game was another solution though people debate its effectiveness."

1601851502.0|gaming|deathinactthree|"> as I understand the writers had a grand finale planned for the series with some cosmic horror, Lovecraft vibes around how you‚Äôre meant to save humanity. Dead Space 3 explored a touch of that with the introduction of the Brethren Moons, but DS4 was supposedly going to explore it, and the intense psychological trauma they cause, more directly and as a component of gameplay.

Yep, 4 was supposed to be about the Brethren Moons, where they came from, and how there's something even worse out there that spawned/created them.  As you said, Lovecraftian-style ""psychological trauma"" was going to be a significant gameplay component.  Unfortunately between the bunch of infighting at EA during the game's creation causing DS3 to go so insanely over budget to the point that it never could have made enough money to be considered profitable, 4 was just starting the storyboard phase IIRC when it got canned.

That said, I did genuinely enjoy the game.  Yes it was more action than horror, but it played really well IMO and had some great moments."

It's a little weird how people still adhere to it though, like it's some major issue. It's almost trivial to resolve an NES that has trouble booting games properly by just bending the pins back into place, and cleaning cartridges and consoles isn't exactly hard either. 

And it's weird because a lot of those people are into tech. If SMB3 doesn't boot they'll take it out and blow on it and re-insert it, but if their graphics card is glitched the idea of ""blowing on it"" is ridiculous, even though it's literally the same type of thing."

343 should have focused on other things the way Reach and ODST did, so I think that's where the storytelling fell apart. Mechanically they're pretty good games (although 5 was a little jinkie) 

I'd say bungies real issue was how rough the first Destiny was at launch and how little storytelling it contained, early days of Destiny 2 weren't much different. Bungie is good at follow up though and both games became great. Bungie's reputation suffers a little bit because people make up their minds about something and rarely give things another chance, they really need to stop shipping unfinished or unpolished things imo"

It does suck that they went through with the boat deal when you said you would just buy another pc and are now going back on the deal. They almost certainly didn't think you'd be able to get another pc so fast. Anyway, it does sound like you spend a lot of time gaming. You say about 9 hours a day, mixed in with homework. Is it obvious to them what part of that time is homework vs what part is gaming? It might just look like all gaming to them. Perhaps it would help to make your time doing homework more obvious. Also they might be concerned about your gaming cutting into your sleep, as based on your schedule you're getting a max of 6 hours a night, which is not enough. If you want to stay at home, perhaps you could have a discussion with them about setting some time limits on your gaming rather than getting rid of the pc all together. I do see the attraction of the freedom of leaving home, but the responsibilities that come with that would definitely cut into your gaming time.

1601850869.0|gaming|BigOlDonkeyPeen21|"343's Halo titles are way more fun than Bungie's in my opinion. The earlier Halo games are too slow and unbalanced. Halo 1's multiplayer is unplayable if you choose to use any weapon that isn't a Magnum, Halo 2's multiplayer seriously lacks impact and is painfully slow, and Halo 3's multiplayer is even slower.

Halo 4 and 5's multiplayers are fluid. You have more movement options than moving from side to side and being caught from behind or above doesn't instantly mean you lose because your opponent landed the first shot. Also, I fucking love the Promethean weaponry. Everything has impact and feels heavy."

I think the internet just has more people complaining than people being positive, 343 really hasn't made a bad game yet imo.

Destiny was made under Activision, so I don't blame Bungie for the issues with Destiny. I am intrigued to see where the game goes, because the core gameplay is solid and Bungie makes a good shooter.

I think both 343 and Bungie are studios that have made some mistakes for sure, but they make solid games overall. I don't think they've tainted Halo's name or ruined Bungie's legacy."

1601850702.0|gaming|kindastandtheman|">You think that the issue of children gambling isn't worthy of mention? Yeah no, this is a major issue that you can't just gloss over, and one the article you linked covered. Loot boxes are gambling, and in most countries children are not allowed to legally gamble. Games either need strong age gates, or they need to drop loot boxes entirely for all countries that prohibit children from gambling.

You're twisting my words, you know damn well that's not what I meant when I typed that out. I can't tell if you're just being intentionally obtuse to what I'm trying to say, or if I was actually on the mark with the delusional old man thing. The point I was making was that children shouldn't even have access to credit cards or digital wallets in the first place. The responsibility should lie with the parent to properly supervise their children. 

The game explicitly states in it's terms of service that any player should be of the age of majority in their country, and that any adult or guardian of the player should be held fully liable for not supervising their children.

>You don't see the problem with children gambling? Are you going to support dropping any current age restrictions concerning gambling, I take it? The laws need to be treated equally in these matters, so long as a 10 year old can't legally bet money on blackjack then the same kid shouldn't be allowed to buy a loot box.

Again, you're cherry picking out my points and not addressing the rest of what I said there. What part of ""these are all optional purchases that you don't need to play or enjoy the game"" doesn't sink it's way into your thick skull? If the content was only available through purchase the. I'd be against it entirely, but it isn't. Everything in that game is unlockable by playing, but if someone wants to speed up their progression by spending $5 on some magic tomes then who cares?

>All the measures you've mentioned are about as effective as the ""Are you 18 or older"". And that's on the company to provide an age gate that actually works, if they can't provide then obviously they need to drop the loot boxes altogether. 

Actually, the responsibility should lie with the parent or guardian of any minor who shouldn't be letting their kid have access to any credit or bank cards in the first place. There is no feasible way for any company to do what you're suggesting, that wouldn't just apply here, but to every service that charges or requires age verification on the internet. In which case you'd be advocating against most online activity for people under the age of 18.

You aren't  one of those people that thinks we should all just microchipped at birth are you?

I recently tried Squadrons and it turns out that it has open mic pre enabled. So you get into a lobby with a Mr Munchies who doesn't care about it being open mic and openly eats and smacks their lips right in our ears for all to hear.

I personally think that games should default to push to talk and let folks control when they want to transmit their voice and when they want to chow down. Cause some folks just don't care if others can hear their mouths smacking and family screaming."

In conclusion I think you are keeping a very reasonable division of work and play and if they keep trying to force you to get rid of your pc, I would suggest trying to find a place away from them if possible.

1601849292.0|gaming|pipboy_warrior|"> ""I'm me, so it's fine when I do it."". Comparing yourself to a delusional old man with dementia, strange stance to take, but more power you.

If you can agree that ad hominems make the argument less effective, that's great.  Though you are still relying on them I notice.

> Well, given that most children don't have credit cards and have to ask their parents for permission to make these sorts of purchases, and that parents are able to view and approve what charges are sent towards their account so figured it wouldn't even be worthy of mention.

You think that the issue of children gambling isn't worthy of mention?  Yeah no, this is a major issue that you can't just gloss over, and one the article you linked covered.  Loot boxes are gambling, and in most countries children are not allowed to legally gamble. Games either need strong age gates, or they need to drop loot boxes entirely for all countries that prohibit children from gambling.

> I think we're just going to have to agree to disagree on this matter, because I don't see the issue with them in this context at all.

You don't see the problem with children gambling?  Are you going to support dropping any current age restrictions concerning gambling, I take it?  The laws need to be treated equally in these matters, so long as a 10 year old can't legally bet money on blackjack then the same kid shouldn't be allowed to buy a loot box.

And so long as games like Genshin Impact allow minors to buy loot boxes, they'll face pressure from international gambling laws.  Companies like EA and Epic have already dropped loot boxes in some games in order to comply, usually adopting the battle pass  model instead.  And as long as people keep complaining and putting on the pressure, loot boxes are going to become less and less common.

> Would like them to put in one of those, ""Are you 18 or older?"" verifications that always seem to work so well?

All the measures you've mentioned are about as effective as the ""Are you 18 or older"".  And that's on the company to provide an age gate that actually works, if they can't provide then obviously they need to drop the loot boxes altogether.  Fortnite, Battlefront 2, Destiny, they all ended up dropping loot boxes largely because all of their respective companies realized that child gambling was an issue that would give them grief.

> But hey, at least you're still acting like a stuck up out of touch old man, so points for consistency.

And you're still using ad hominems to support shitty loot boxes.  Is this really the hill you want to die on, saying it's only old people that hate loot boxes?"

But no developer bothers making it work like this so for 99% of use cases it's a pointless waste of battery life. I have an Xbox Elite series 2 controller but still use my DS4 over it because of the gyro and touchpad."

- Borderlands, Starlink and Outward to have exciting adventures together.  
- Tekken 7 and Dead or Alive 6 to have a friendly competition.  
- Super Bomberman R and Portal 2 if you want her to hate your guts. And viceversa; the difference between an accidental killing and an ""accidental"" killing is slim indeed.  

Friend of mine recommended the Divinity: Original Sin duology to me as well, but I haven't been able to play them yet so dunno where they'd fit; probably with Outward.

All those are multiplatform since you didn't specify, but two exclusives I'd also recommend are Kirby Super Star for the Switch, and Halo: Master Chief Collection for Xbox, both really great for local, couch co-op."

He found them again years later and upon this rediscovery, he has gained new insights that allow him to appreciate the album on a deeper level than he previously could. Just like some similar music in the Post/Prog-rock world, it took him some time to truly appreciate the album. He attempts to elaborate more but he knows that what he gets out of it isn't going to be the same as another listener. He enjoyed the ups and downs, through the oppressive melancholy and to the minuscule glimmer of hope hidden within. The album clearly means a lot to OP and he felt the need to share his emotions relating to it. Not too sure what wasn't clear in what he said but I hope I managed to clear it up for you. Godspeed You! Black Emperor.

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

What happened with the Khmer Rouge was CIA-backed authoritarianism that was then used as propaganda to have further demonize communism and to prevent China & Vietnam from controlling all of Indochina. 

""The U.S. permitted Thailand to allow the Khmer Rouge to use bases in Thailand to wage a war of insurrection against the government in Phnom Penh that had been installed by Vietnam. Elizabeth Becker reported that U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski claimed that he ""concocted the idea of persuading Thailand to cooperate fully in efforts to rebuild the Khmer Rouge.""

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback

There are so many good drummers out there across all the genres, that it'd be really hard to decide for me. Travis does have that super solid background of drum corps behind him, but I've always been more preferential to a drumming style that is more free-form in nature. I definitely feel that Blink did get quite a bit better with Travis coming in after Chesire and Dude Ranch, though. That's for sure.

And, tbh, I started to kind of stray away from *Strung Out* after Blackhawks, so I haven't really listened to their newer stuff all that much. But I have seen some videos of Shankle playing some of their older stuff, and he really does do a good job emulating Jordan's playing style. You can tell he's in touch with that more metal side of *Strung Out*. Which is cool.

1601844087.0|Music|HurricaneDane|"Wow! That is strikingly similar.

I was going to comment on [sampling other artists](https://youtu.be/v89CjsSOJ_c), but this seems like a different case. There's the possibility that they're using that riff with permission, although that seems unlikely. 
Could there be a crossover between musicians from both bands? I did a quick google search but didn't find much.

While it's likely that it was a blatant ripoff, it's also possible that someone heard it, liked it and forgot about it, and then pulled it out later during songwriting.  
Check out Jorge Ben Jor's [*Taj Mahal*](https://youtu.be/rfrpOhC6858) (1972).  
Sound familiar?  
Here's Rod Stewart's [*Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?](https://youtu.be/Hphwfq1wLJs) (1978).

This happens all the time in the music industry. Sometimes it's ok, sometimes people get sued. It's possible that this case has already been addressed and closed. 

It looks like Cody Fry has both [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/codyfry?lang=en) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/codyfry/?hl=en) accounts, you could try to reach out to him on one of those and see if there's more to the story."

Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback

* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

1601838196.0|Music|odst94|"I think there's a common misconception that equates punk bands to anarchy just because they sing against governments. These bands are against our applications of government, not the concept of government itself.

>Why didn't anyone make a song telling them to go out and vote?

Fat Mike kick-started punkvoter.org specifically to register kids to vote in 04. This was when both of the Rock Against Bush compilations and tour raised $1 million for John Kerry. Franco un-American is specifically about how Fat Mike finally cares about politics and not nihilism or anarchism. Anarchy Camp exists, but NoFX have always had songs of fantasy: Pharmacist's Daughter, Mattersville, S&M Airlines, the Man I Killed.

Neither Anti-Flag nor Bad Religion or those other bands anarchist. They're both very progressive and their views align with Bernie Sanders, an opponent to anarchism. Robin Hood in Reverse and the Economy is Suffering... Let it Die are calls for progressivism, government assistance towards the working class and poor.

""Here's the church, there's the steeple, open up the doors corporations are people, wait what did he say? What the fuck did he say?""

""I've seen a lot of bailouts in my life. But why is it I never see a bailout for the homeless and the poor?"""

The Eagles - classic rock

Def Leppard - 80's hair metal

Glitch Mob - I have no idea how to genre this

Murder by Death - western/folk/kind of like Johnny cash in the later albums (this is my favorite bands of all time.)

The Misfits - classic punk

Vivaldi - baroque (soft listening)

Beethoven - power classical

Chopin - revolutionary piano

Credence Clearwater Revival - classic rock/folk something. One of the best bands to ever band. 

Elvis Presley - they didn't crown him the king of rock for no reason

Andy Williams - an amazing crooner, overshadowed by the equally amazing Frank Sinatra

Frank Sinatra - personally I liked his acting better, still a great crooner

Henry Mancini - fantastic jazz. Peter gunn and Hatari are great soundtracks

Ennio Morricone - amazing composer. During their S&M concert, Metallica tributed him by playing the Ecstasy Of Gold."

1601836017.0|Music|Procrastinatron|"Man, everything's so fucking complicated. I can't decide whether or not I should care where my music comes from. I mean, on the one hand the comment you're talking about makes me cringe, because I am at my core a democratic socialist. Then I read the article linked below, and I see Buzzo's point (although the Nazi comment still irks me). Then I start wondering if I'm supposed to do research on every single thing that I consume. Because, I mean, on a certain level it sort of makes sense that I should, because I do want to be at least a *somewhat* ethical person. But given how complex and just outright complicated the world is now, that seems like a one-way street to becoming a pathologically fussy, neurotic mess that is so bothered by the potential consequences of my every decision that I just get stuck in a state of perpetual indecision and ethical inadequacy.

By the time the short set ended, the whole store had been looted of tons of CDs. It was a pretty epic night."

> Cassandra Wilson (born 4th December 1955) is a U.S. jazz vocalist and two-time Grammy Award winner from Jackson, Mississippi. Two of her albums, Blue Skies (1988) and New Moon Daughter (1996), have topped the US jazz charts, and the latter also won her a Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Performance in 1997. More recently, Wilson's album Loverly (2008) also won the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album at the 51st Grammy Awards in 2009.

> Wilson's repertoire includes both jazz and blues standards and renditions of pop and rock songs. Her contralto voice has been described as bluesy and sultry, and the style of her music ranges from swing to funk to bossa nova. Many of the songs she covers are by artists who usually record in other genres.

> Wilson counts the late Miles Davis as one of her greatest influences. In 1989 she performed as the opening act for Davis at the JVC Jazz Festival in Chicago. In 1999 she produced Traveling Miles as a tribute to Davis. The album developed from a series of jazz concerts that she performed at Lincoln Center in November 1997 in Davis's honor and includes three selections based on Davis's own compositions, in which Wilson adapted the original themes.

1601832872.0|Music|TheCheechWizardUnit|Yes a cliche but totally awesome! That's why it's a cliche! It is a great song because it basically has all the chords you will *almost* ever need while playing the uke. If you want a beginner's too for that song only play the C, G, Am, Em and F...skip the other chords for now and maybe forever. Lol  Now go find a YouTuber that teaches it! Have fun!

These belong in /r/ifyoulikeblank or /r/recordstore, active communities that specialize in making recommendations.

When they did Punk in Drublic at Red Rocks it was off the charts crazy. (They didn't do it in it's entirety, their manager just said they would on the radio). Nothing like a mosh pit on the stairs of Red Rocks, and watching people roll down them."

It‚Äôs not debatable, same concept as when Sinatra covered a song.  The previous 20 other covers and all covers after are forgotten.  Take a song like ‚ÄúOne For My Baby‚Äù hundreds of covers by HOF artists but people only remember that Frank sang it.

1601829570.0|Music|DXsocko007|"I honestly find punk insanely childish. More so now. I mean these guys have been saying ""F*** the gov"" since I was 14 years old it's been 20 years making them well over 50. They still dress the same and look the same. Like seriously dudes grow up. All their music has gotten worse with time. Not one punk or ska band has done something good in the last 15 years.

You can hate the gov and I'm totally ok with that. I just think anarchy is way more dumb than democracy. Why didn't anyone make a song telling them to go out and vote? I say all this coming from the guy who had tons of bad religion, lagwagon, mellincolin, antiflag and many many more. It's all I listened to.

You can listen to what you love and I won't judge. For me I just can't get into it like i did. I just love me some phil collins, huey lewis, and hall and oates. I need music that makes me happy. If punk get you going and clicks with you... STICK WITH IT AND LOVE IT."

1601827935.0|Music|AutoModerator|"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

These belong in /r/ifyoulikeblank or /r/recordstore, active communities that specialize in making recommendations. Similarly, posts that ask for help identifying a song (whether it's the name of the track or a link to it) are not permitted. You may direct these kinds of posts to /r/tipofmytongue and /r/namethatsong. Generally, any request seeking a sole (or limited) identifiable answer(s) is subject to removal.

1601824112.0|Music|pub_gak|"As I remember, they started out as Massive Attack. Then, when commentating on Operation Shock and Awe, the BBC commentator said ‚ÄúThe attack was swift and massive...‚Äù

They‚Äôre pretty right-on people in that band, and I think they were a bit horrified to be conceptually connected to the Gulf War (which I imagine they opposed)

So they changed their name to Massive, and kept it that way for years. 

I was there at the time, and that‚Äôs how I remember it, but I may be wrong.

I love them. Unfinished Sympathy is my joint favourite track evar."

At the end of the show they even had a little heart to heart about how they're grateful for their audience and the life they've been given. It was a really good show.

Before that I saw them 20ish years ago and Mike was fucked up beyond redemption, beat up a kid in the crowd for spitting and one of my dumb buddies broke his neck stagediving into a crowd of preppies to teach them the dangers of going to punk shows.  
We're still laughing at that one. Except him, of course. He's more, like, drooling mirthfully.

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions.

1601820817.0|Music|AutoModerator|"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

I remember being in high school and buying this alongside their albums Pump Up The Valium and So Long And Thanks For All The Shoes and wondering why my CD player wasnt going up on the song list playing the Decline. I remember looking at the case trying to figure out the different song names before realizing it was just one big song.

1601852742.0|pics|bobfromsanluis|"In my humble opinion, that message only is valid if both ""wings"" are treating everyone he same, using the same tactics as the other, and is held to the same standard by the press and voters.  That doesn't happen; conservatives always get a break in the media, liberals are usually ignored, if possible.  Remember when the Tea Party first got started?  Usually a hand full of people would gather, with signs about how bad Obama was, some of them mis-spelled, some of them featuring racists memes with Obama's likeness altered to show him as a witch doctor or some other racist shit.  The press was besides themselves breathlessly reporting on this growing ""movement""- but when there is world wide protests about climate change or social injustice, with millions of people all over the world participating, the press is unusually quiet, with very little reporting.  Democrats in Congress can call press conferences that get ignored, while any Republican stepping up to a microphone is portrayed as a decisive leader, someone who needs to be listened to as a serious spokesperson.  Show me where I'm wrong and I will then agree with the message shared here."

You can't say that what I typed is wrong.  It's a matter of history anyone can research.  You're more than happy to blame republicans, but can't cite anything they've done that is ""engaging in bad faith.""  

Gerrymandering?  Ha!  Democrats have been the kings of the gerrymander since I've been alive.  IL, NJ, NY, and MD have been doing it since at least the 70s, and their current election maps make the republicans look tame by comparison.  NY has districts that are separated by bodies of water and aren't even geographically contiguous, and you want to cry about gerrymandering?  You're a riot, guy.

You already have your imaginary 'moderate' republicans.  They got the message they were no longer wanted after Trump was elected.  Now they're all working on *The Election Integrity Project* or *The Lincoln Project*.  Those were the idiots who wanted to compromise, because they just wanted a light-weight version of the democrats were going to do anyway.

1601852273.0|pics|Reacher-Said-N0thing|">  And why is that happening.

Proud Boys are a weird far-right militia in the states.  Wikipedia calls them ""far-right and neo-fascist"".  FBI has them designated as an extremist group with links to white supremacy.  Lately they've been showing up to BLM protests and attacking protesters.

During the Trump/Biden debates, the moderator asked Trump to denounce white supremacy.  Instead he randomly brought up Proud Boys (which neither the moderator nor Biden had mentioned) and famously said ""Proud boys... stand back, and stand by"".  A subtle signal that he's on their side.

People justifiably are pissed off about that and are flooding the internet with some less hateful imagery with the ""proud boys"" hashtag, involving two proud loving boys."

By claiming the phrase ‚ÄúProud Boys‚Äù as part of gay pride, I feel as though they‚Äôre trying to indirectly trying to make the actual Proud Boys embarrassed by connecting it something gay. The goal is to get people thinking of gay men instead of racists, meaning the intention is to make them upset by indirectly calling them gay. As a gay man, I feel offended by this. Being gay shouldn‚Äôt be something to be disgusted by. But that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs going on here.

The reality is quite different than the narrative.  I fully supported Obama and voted for him twice.  After 8 years of Obama and just under 4 years of Trump it is GLARINGLY obvious who the more effective president is, and that is hands down Trump. 

Obama was a zero in a suit.  I really, really wished he was a great president.  He wasn't.  Trump, on the other hand, is running around like a maniac just getting things done one after another.  Tax reform, bringing troops home, moving the embassy in israel, signing peace deals, police reform, deporting criminals, securing the border, increasing minority wealth, increasing minority employment, appointment countless judges approved by the federalist society, and completely rearranging the global order. 

Obama couldn't have done any of those things because he just wasn't a good enough politician to accomplish them, as he fully admitted himself.  Clinton was a master politician and actually got stuff done with divided government.  Trump enjoyed a friendly Congress for two years but even after he still managed to do things people said were impossible (like moving the embassy and creating long term stability for the israelis). 

I think Obama is a nice man, a man who obviously very much loves his family and a good human being.   He was a god-awful president though, and I don't see how anyone with a brain could think otherwise."

Canadian Fred Hamilton would describe being singled out for a beating by a German colonel after he was taken prisoner. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care for the English, Scotch, French, Australians or Belgians but damn you Canadians, you take no prisoners and you kill our wounded,‚Äù the colonel told him.

While all Commonwealth units were encouraged to conduct trench raids, Canadians were widely regarded as trench raiding‚Äôs most enthusiastic practitioners and innovators.

At the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, visitors can see a case filled with the fearsome homemade weapons that Canadians trench raiders plunged into the faces and chests of their enemy: Meat cleavers, push daggers and spiked clubs.

Canadians even exploited the trust of Germans who had apparently become accustomed to fraternizing with allied units. Lieutenant Louis Keene described the practice of lobbing tins of corned beef into a neighbouring German trench. When the Canadians started hearing happy shouts of ‚ÄúMore! Give us more!‚Äù they then let loose with an armload of grenades.

In one case, a Canadian surreptitiously slipped a live grenade into the greatcoat pockets of a German prisoner.

Probably why we started saying sorry so much."

1601851454.0|pics|Ask_me_4_a_story|"When I was just getting ready for college Iowa did so much advertising. I had never heard Iowa PR before and I dont remember hearing it since. Its like Iowa took all the tourism money they ever had and put it all into one campaign over a two year period. The campaign slogan back then was IOWA- YOU MAKE ME SMILE! 

God damn we got so into that. We actually sent off (this was back before any of us had the internet) but you could call the 1800 number and they would send you stickers and shirts and shit. If anyone ever said the world Iowa we would all look at each other and say, IOWA YOU MAKE ME SMILE! There were billboards in Kansas City, St. Joe, Columbia, St. Louis, everywhere we went there were billboards that said that. I went to school in Kirksville, MO which was less than an hour away from Iowa so one cold windy blustery Saturday we all decided to see if the billboards were true. We piled into Johnnys beat up old Chevy Cavalier and drove the 45 minutes to Iowa and made it to the State Line. It was empty and barren. A sign had spraypainted Nothing on it instead of Iowa. So the sign said Welcome to Nothing. 

We got out of the car and started screaming COME ON IOWA DO IT GODDAMNIT. Make me SMIIIIILE IOWA! YOU FUCKIN LIAR STATE MAKE ME SMILE. I don't know what we were angry about but it felt good to yell at a whole state. The advertisements were lies. We started to wonder if all advertising was lies. They promised designer jeans would make us happy and cologne and albums and clothes and Pepsi. But they were all empty promises. None of those things would make us happy. A trip. A University degree. Salaries. Engagement rings. We knew it was all bullshit. All as empty and void as Iowa itself."

Current Proud Boys leader¬†Enrique Tarrio, who is Afro-Cuban, says the group has ""longstanding regulations prohibiting racist, white supremacist¬†or violent activity,"" Ronald D. Coleman wrote in an email to USA TODAY. Coleman said he is a¬†spokesman for the Proud Boys.

""We do not care what¬†color you are or what your¬†background is ... if you love America ... we consider you a brother,""¬†Tarrio said in a written statement provided by¬†Coleman. The group condemns racism, fascism, communism and socialism, the statement says.

Weird... why would a white supremacist have an Afro-Cuban leader? Why would they condemn racism in all its forms?

Why does the word of a single professor in michigan count as proof the PB are white nationalists?

[https://web.archive.org/web/20201002071342if\_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/30/proudboys1001/](https://web.archive.org/web/20201002071342if_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/30/proudboys1001/)

Here the Biden offering up the proud bpys as an example of a white supremacist group is apparently enough to make them that.  No other evidence is required.

[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/2/trump-denounces-all-white-supremacists-including-proud-boys](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/2/trump-denounces-all-white-supremacists-including-proud-boys)

Here Trump denoucnign white supremacy (again) and condemning the Proud Boys is used as proof the Proud Boys are racist. Despite Trump saying he does not know anything about the group. Why would that count as proof that the PB are white supremacists? Trump said he didnt know anything about them.

Wow fighting with antifa is proof the Proud Boys are white supremacists. Talk about circular logic...

Why dont you do what I asked and give me evidence of the Proud Boys endorsing or engaging in white supremacist rhetoric?

Why didnt you provide any evidence at all of the Proud Boys being homophobic?

Quote a Proud Boy endorsing white supremacy.

Quote a Proud Boy endorsing homophobia.

Explain why the Proud Boys are lead by an afro-cuban american if they are a white supremacist group?

Explain why a white supremacist group would not only allow non white members but be lead by them.

Explain why a homophobic group would allow gay members and invite well known gay men to be speakers and guests of honor at their events.

Think ya can do that?"

1601850904.0|pics|verdifer|"> Joe Biden would do a good job, since Trump spent almost all of the debate attacking him on a personal level

Well I can't see into the future and my logic doesn't mean he will do a good job. But if Trump is attacking him on a personal level, in my mind it means he has very little to attack him on a work level i.e. policies, how he would govern etc etc. If the guys doing PR for Biden had any sense they would pick up on this and use it to their advantage. You don't need to like whoever is in charge on a personal level, but you do need to like what they are doing.

In respect to the problems you highlight with the Trump regime like ICE for example, ICE was created in 2003 by the Bush administration. As for leaving the Kurds, leaving behind those that helped you is something America does over and over, Iraq is an example where the regime after Saddam was allowed to kill folks who helped America without a thing said by anyone. 

People highlight the Obama years as if they were a success, when in fact they were an abject failure. If Obama was not a black man the view on him would be different. You said ""0 in eight years for Obama"", which I will take as being true, but how many children were killed by drone strikes in places like the villages in Pakistan, I have a friend from Pakistan and he says that these are 1 of the main reasons why the East hates America. If America thought a guy they were after was hiding in a village they would drone bomb it, many innocent people including women and children were killed. The Obama administration held the record for the most drone strikes and prob did more for terrorist recruitment than any video they made. And keep in mind may of these terrorist organisations were at some point funded or trained by US soldiers, you mention Russia but leave out how America funded the mujahideen with billions to kill Russians in the 70's/80's.

Now don't get me wrong here, I'm in no way defending Trump, but if you look at things - it's the same shit over and over with a different guy in the White House. When it came to Trump running for president the other option was a Clinton FFS, putting a Clinton up is as good as throwing a few million votes away. A country of 320 million people and this is the best 2 you could find. Do you really think Biden will make that much of a difference? 

I think Trump will win again, well I should rephrase that better ""I think the Democrats will lose again"" because like Trump v Clinton I come back to my ""a country of 320 million people and that's the best you can do"". The Democrats need to get a leader folks can relate to and fight Trump with their policies. Don't fight Trump on Social Media with personal attacks, fight him with policies - if folks choose to fight on Social Media they will lose as you are on his battleground."

But in my opinion ""having unlimited power"" does not equate to ""being able to do anything."" As an example solution, if God were to create a stone in a vacuum, in a universe completely free of any other object or force, there would be no frame of reference by which to discern ""up"" from ""down"". Taking the definition of ""lift,"" from Merriam Webster, as ""to raise from a lower to a higher position"", there would be no way to meaningfully designate any position as being lower or higher, and therefore, no mater how much power one has, and no matter how much force one exerts on the rock, one can not meaningfully lift the stone. Because the inability to lift the stone does not stem from a lack of power, the existence of such a stone does not preclude God from ""having unlimited power,"" or being ""Almighty,"" at least in that sense."

Any good pediatrician, who were all educated with similar standards, is going to vaccinate by default. It's just part of the schedule for the first couple of years of pediatrician visits which is usually set up by the time you leave a hospital after having a baby. And when most kids begin to go to school if they don't have their vaccinations by then the school requires a record of them, at least in the US, so they're really forced to get them if they are going to public school which is the majority of the US kids. Sure, there are exemptions for medical issues and for religion, etc, but even those things are such a pain in the ass that lazy people would rather just get the vaccinations. Even 30 to 60% of society being vaccinated is enough to slow or stop the spread of most viruses. We mostly achieve that through having standards in the schools.

Hanke, L., Vidakovics Perez, L., Sheward, D.J. et al. 

Nature Communications volume 11, Article number: 4420 (2020) 

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18174-5

Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through an interaction between the spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. Ty1 binds the RBD with high affinity, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9‚Äâ√Ö resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the ‚Äòup‚Äô and ‚Äòdown‚Äô conformations, sterically hindering RBD-ACE2 binding. While fusion to an Fc domain renders Ty1 extremely potent, Ty1 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus as a 12.8‚ÄâkDa nanobody, which can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19."

We have no baseline of what could count as safe or what (outside of common sense) would dictate dangerous. Most doctors and governments recommend no alcohol at all because of the fact that we have very little idea of what constitutes 'safe'. The general stance is ""well if we don't know what IS safe, we should assume it isn't safe at all for the health and wellness of the baby."" It can lead to a lot of women feeling extreme guilt for drinking during the period of time that they were pregnant but not yet aware of that fact.

1601838099.0|science|Aeronor|"You're right we don't have the full article, unfortunately. But let's assume for the sake of argument that the device works exactly as you described. Although I will make a slight modification, and say that for efficiency's sake, instead of the device sitting at room temperature, it would be part of a heatsink assembly on a computer.

We can convert heat into electricity using thermal expansion (piezoelectrics between layers of material, perhaps something like this: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/773/1/012073/pdf). Mechanically removing heat from an object to charge a circuit seems perfectly plausible. There does have to be a temperature gradient for it to work, which is why I chose not to have the device just sitting on a table at room temperature, for comparison's sake.

Now, I will certainly admit that there is room to argue whether or not this energy transfer could be done on an atomic scale with a diode. But I don't agree that heat converted to electricity has to violate thermodynamics. I'm sure there would be loss somewhere that could create extra entropy if we really wanted to look for it."

1601837655.0|science|DPJazzy91|Right now our only method for creating energy from heat is to run expanding gas or liquid through a turbine.  All the other methods are terrible.  graphene in general would be amazing for fusion reactors because you could use them for superconducting conduit for the electromagnets and you could use them for the shielding of the housing and if the heat harvesting can be improved they could be used to siphon energy off without having to connect the reactor to a turbine or something like that.  Their energy output is going to be pretty low though.  I highly doubt that the energy per square foot can get high enough to make it useful and something like a reactor.  I see it as more of an extra layer on solar panels to boost efficiency and get a little more energy out of them.  But mainly as uninterrupted constant power for some microelectronics in computers.  Stuff like preventing the computer's clock from losing time when it's battery dies.  Or keeping power to RAM so it doesn't lose data.  And sensors and stuff like that.

It could power low voltage sensors, so they never go offline. It could also be used to harvest additional heat out of exhaust from turbines, and other engines, or really any heat sources.  Print a layer of them underneath solar panels.  Use some of that heat to get more juice per square foot of panel.

The whole circuit is kept at the same temp.

Apparently there was some detectable current (AC) even without the diodes. However the wattage was ridiculously low. Adding the diodes which would norally decrease efficiency of a  circuit, actually increased it because it allowed an electron concentration to build up enough to overcome the resistance of the wire.

Btw we are still likely talking about femtowatts of power. 

But because the actual size of the graphene would be inconsequential to the number of electrons tunneling the diode (because only the electron beside the diode matters) millions of these circuits could be combined in parallel theoretically to produce microwatts of power.

Here in lies the problem, unless your goal is to convert heat in to heat a micrometre away, you need an extremely efficient conductor (like more double layers of graphene) to transmit the electrons far enough to actually connect millions of these circuits in parallel, and have an abundance of them to do work with other than make more heat."

Are they actually getting some differential heating of the graphene sheet from light in the room or picking up energy from E&M waves in the environment?

There seem to be lots of issues here. One being that this is a retrospective study where people are recalling behavior from a decade ago, and trying to associate that behavior with outcomes in 9 year old kids. Again, I‚Äôd like to see what else their model controls for because a lot can happen in 10 years.

Also, 6 drinks a week is not what most would consider low-consumption. The article says most of this occurred in the first 6-7 weeks of pregnancy (so within 2-3 weeks of a missed period) before women knew they were pregnant. This would indicate they were drinking that amount regularly before pregnancy. I don‚Äôt know for sure, but I‚Äôd hazard a guess that people with more anxiety might be more prone to drinking. I do know that anxiety and depression are heritable, meaning partially genetic. The researchers would need to control for this in their model.

I've seen this kind of thing (the rare metals type) used on a woodburning stove where the hot and cold side are both in touch with aluminum extrusions. The aluminum on the hot side transfers heat from the surface of the stove to the generator thing and the aluminum on the cold side acts as a heat sink where the heat can radiate out into the room from. The electricity is then used to spin a small fan that pushes the hot air out into the room but also helps remove heat from the aluminum extrusion on the cold side so a higher temperature difference can be maintained.

1601830724.0|science|Apophthegmata|"I don't see a lottery going over well. Because if your name *doesn't* get called you're basically telling parents that their child's access to a free and appropriate public education is going to be curtailed - without parent consent. And there's the whole mindset of parents who see taxes and schools as being a transaction where they have purchased curtain outcomes. But parents aren't the clients of an educational institution, their kids are. 

 This is easier to handle of you say that all students of a particular class - say all students classified as at risk - are *guaranteed* a seat, and all non-at-risk (however a school wishes to define it) will remain in distance learning with no choice for a certain length of time. 

Otherwise you may end up with students whose situations are actually identical but have received a different outcome because one received a golden ticket and the other did not. I know some schools have done this lottery thing but I would be worried that a family would file suit if they didn't win - and have a shot of being correct on the merits of the case. Random may be fair in one sense but still be discriminatory in another. 

It'll also depend on the rules set in place by the state educational agency. Over here, the by-line is all instruction must be ""equivalent"" but need not be ""identical"" between distance learners and on campus students. This is a rule I know for a fact isn't required (or being enforced) elsewhere where distance learners are receiving a much watered down version of the curriculum compared to their on campus peers. 

So in short, I'm wary of the reasonableness of putting random chance in the driver's seat when it comes to ensuring **equity**, even if every child is being treated *equally* under such a lottery system. Those weighted criteria will only go so far."

Take states which don't have mask mandates and that have fully opened like Florida.  Your restaurants, bars and gyms can be open without concern. Sure cases might go up, but your banking on that the increased influx of people will offset the sick people and deaths that can't shop.

For the individual, compliance provides access to stores because many places do have mandates.

Many people avoid masks by wearing them incorrectly (not covering nose or sometimes even mouth) or by ""eating/drinking"" stuff slowly while they walk around places they need masks.  They are showing ""compliance"" but are not actually complying. 

So fake compliance gives you a ""monetary benefit"" of being able to shop in person and hang out with people without having the issues of proper compliance.  They also won't get fined (which is a ""law"" in some states and cities).  They effectively are taking the benefit of being protected from the majority who wear masks while putting everyone else at risk. They also avoid monetary damages for noncompliance.

Not really. People in other countries were told to stay at home for two weeks, and even though they did it, the quarantine got pushed back several times. Then they were told to wear a mask and they did it. Then they were told to (over)use sanitizing gel and they did it. That without taking into account all the other rules that were placed on public transport, stores, gatherings, etc.

Considering that pretty much no country is restriction-less, following the rules or not is not a factor on the existence of restrictions.

Currently, they are too expensive to scale to the size needed to extract any significant energy from exhausts but that could change with new technologies that do the same. The usefulness is that this can extract energy from exhaust gasses that can't drive a turbine directly and are too cool to create high pressure gasses.

Those blue areas directly on the coast such as in Jacksonville, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach County make up a huge part of Florida's population to the point of outweighing Orlando and Gainsville. Not to mention all the cities in between WPB, Fort Lauderdale, and Miami that are all strongly blue and pretty high in population on their own. The southeast population of Florida is huge and very democrat. The republican population is far more spread out so any effect on specific geographic areas will usually effect them less based on that alone (assuming a concentrated democrate area is included at all, which they are and were).

And no, Miami is not mostly red on the coast. There are a few spots directly on the coast, mostly around pompano, less so Miami, where residential areas are less concentrated and the population is concentrated a little bit back from the coast.

edit: And I'm saying this as a southeast Florida democrat. As much as I want this study to be true, it does not make any sense with how Florida's population is distributed and which areas braced for Irma."

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse\_incentive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive)

Employers would spend a lot of time and wasted effort getting around a simple wage cap. They would have to find legal and grey area ways to pay people indirectly, be it through benefits, luxury office accommodations, company cars, ridiculous vacation allowances or duplicate staff. More than likely it would end up with a massive increase in the 'consultification' of many professions. You wouldn't have a CEO, you would pay a consulting fee to a business to lease a CEO for five years that would just be a huge wage cap avoidance scheme. 

It would turn getting paid into what paying taxes is, a hugely complicated nightmare that only the rich can afford to play. It would create a lot of waste in the system that management consulting law and accounting firms would love. 

This is similar to why exorbitantly paid CEOs are paid in stock options that are taxed at capital gains rates - and the most clever can even find a way to hold in tax free investment vehicles. Read about Mitt Romney's fortune."

Yes there is.  From an international trade standpoint, other importers will flock to you when trading is easier.  

Country A has few trade barriers.  But their product quality is 80% of country B.  
Country B has many inspection points, red tape, political agendas involved in trade.

If the price is equal, some will go with A some with B.  Once the price of A goes under B, importers will exponentially flock to country A.  

Now speaking of price.  China and Brazil both have the luxury of manipulating their currencies value.  The US floats theirs.  If you look at the Real vs Yen, in 2018 it was 2.4 to 1.  Today it's 1.19 to 1.  China has twice the purchasing power today as just a few years ago.

Chomsky's point was that the US was using propaganda to emphasize khmer rouge atrocities whilst downplaying US ones.

Chomsky also spread some false information about the atrocities being fewer and farther between than were widely reported, although he walked that back and apologized. He trusted sources that he shouldn't have. 

Ultimately that doesn't seem like a very fucking controversial take to me, tbh, and since at the time Chomsky was well aware of some of the other horrific shit the US was doing in the name of ""containment"" I'm hard pressed to even fault him for trusting his sources about the khmer rouge over official reports."

So, at this point, all Catholic charity (and discounting by 75% all the labor provided for free by a conservative estimate of religious) is at around $5billion and the Gates foundation around $5billion again in spending. 

Now, if I *just* include Catholic spending on hospitals in the US from the economist article, this will absolutely blow the Gates foundation out of the water. The economist estimates the Church spends $98.6 billion on healthcare, so that's $103 billion, *conservatively*, which absolutely dominates any charity on this list. I could continue, but it would just be unfair honestly. The Church is so large and has such a presence and has so many people working for it that it's just too hard to beat.

Without regulation the corporate entities simply end up hiring military and police forces to suppress labor (see also your history books) or anyone else standing in the way of their profit and goals (see also current tech factories in poor far eastern nations).

Do you not see the problem here? Its my money it ought to be spent how I want it to. If its not spent how I want it to thats because someone took it and is spending it how they want. They are spending my money. Thats theft. 

I'm not saying I haven't reaped the benefits of taxes. Just like you, assuming you're in the US or somewhere that has amazon, have benefited from the convince of anything delivered to you. That being possible because of capitalism. But corporations asking for money and getting it, is not capitalism. Just like getting corporate tax breaks isn't capitalism. Im not saying capitalism perfect, but im also not condemning its existence and claiming im right and you're wrong. There is room for some middle ground. Thats typically where the answer lies in most situations. The only claim I've made, again, to be right is that taking something that is mine, against my will, no matter how it is used whether for good or bad. That is mine the government took it, I didn't want them to. Thats theft. If I take something of yours and I do good with it. I still stole it from you, its still theft. Theft is a deontological issue, its unethical to take something from someone against their wishes.

This statement depends on what you mean by ""all powerful."" The Abrahamic religions generally consider God to be all powerful in that he created everything, he can destroy everything, he determined the laws of physics, and he can break the laws of physics. Never do any of these religions claim that God can break the laws of *logic.* 

In other words, God can cause one loaf of bread to split into two larger loaves of bread, but he can't make one loaf of bread that is actually two loaves of bread. Expecting God to find a way to both allow humans the option to do bad things, and simultaneously not allow bad things to happen, is like expecting God to make two plus two equal five.

I'm no philosopher, but I imagine that a more rigorous definition of this idea would have something to do with Plato's idea of the Realm of Forms as opposed to the Realm of Appearances. The Realm of Appearances is where we live. We have horses, and circles, and atoms, etc. The Realm of Forms is where only concepts live. It contains the idea of a horse, the idea of a circle, etc. The Realm of Forms contains the perfect circle. All circles we ever see in the Realm of Appearances aren't quite perfect - they'll just never be quite exactly 2pi radians.

I have a very deep understanding of who the Jesuits are and what they stand for. I was raised Catholic, I was a leader of men, a believer in Jesus. I lead many spiritual retreats. I befriended a Jesuit & traveled to Japan with him and our Japanese History class, he was my best friend. We kept in contact. I was there for his final days when he passed away. We spoke about the uncertainties and mystery of life in his final days. It is human nature to question, stray from, or come back into God's grace. I appreciate your prayer. My life journey is far from over, and I am open to new experiences physicals or spiritual. At this point in my life, where we meet, it just so happens that I'm at odds with religion.

1601851739.0|worldnews|HeadmasterPrimeMnstr|"> Economically, socialism is still a capitalist system.

It absolutely is not. An economy is the ways in which a society distributes resource among it's population and the means through which it is achieved. Capitalism involves the private ownership over the means of production (land, factories, businesses, equipment, resources etc...) while socialism involves the democratic ownership of the means of production by those who labour under it. These are two opposed ideals.

You can have socialist institutions in a capitalism market economy and vis versa, but socialism is by definition **not a capitalist system.**

> Did you know we have a stock market in Canada too?

Did you know that stock markets are antithetical to socialism since it involves private ownership over the means of production and involves people being able to make passive income over something they invested no labour towards?

Economics have an effect on political institutions just as much as political institutions have an effect on the economy.

> After 25 years on the internet, this still holds true: every kid expect everyone else to be a high-school kid.

1601851689.0|worldnews|JanGuillosThrowaway|"I am disappointed in that you didn't read the source. It is clearly worse than it was 10 years ago, and that change has happened since Bolsonaro came into power. 

Deforestation was as bad in the 90's and early 00's, however that was before climate change was widely accepted and the effects of it were clear to see. With new scientific developments, deforestation rates reduced rapidly and significantly, up until Bolsonary came into office.

The main problem is the feedback loop though, and how the eventual loss of the Amazon will destroy the agricultural lands with extend periods of droughts and floods. The droughts in themselves will also destroy the Amazon, leading to more droughts and so on.

It is not that the media, and academics, hates the Bolsonaro government that is the problem. Ignore the media for now, even. Why would the academics go against Bolsonaro on this, if they didn't have reason? Shouldn't Bolsonaro and his government have trust in science, and the scientific models, both regarding the ecological and economical impact of the deforestation?

It seems to me that you're kinda agreeing with Bolsonaro to agree with Bolsonaro, and that's again where a critical eye might be important. As I said, I also had problems with the failings of my party before, but then I realized that holding them to a higher standard might not only be productive but also strengthen their political agenda in general."

In the most simple terms Someone needs to hunt and someone needs to gather. You can trade what you have for other things that you need.

You are trading the time you spent fishing for someone else's time they spent collecting the rice. You cannot just have that fish just magicaly exsist without putting in the work to catch it.

If you don't like your current job and feel it's not compensating you enough you can go with another company that is paying korey get an interview  and if hired quit your current one and if you want to be paid more then get skills that will increase your worth. The ceo of mccdonalds is getting paid more then the burger flipper because the ceo is more expiernced and has a harder job to do. You don't have to go to college in order to get a good job today. There is a shitload of information that is easily accessible today on what you want to do for a living. If Im interviewing two people and one of them has a degree in the job I'm offering and the other one does not, I can give a rats ass about the piece of paper, the purpose of the interview is to see who knows how to get the jobs done and who knows more about what the job pertains to.

> DEFINITION OF THE CHILD

>45. Chilean legislation provides no definition of the child. It does, however, clearly establish the age of majority, that is the full capacity to perform civil acts, at 21. In this connection it should be mentioned that a bill to lower the age of majority to 18 is being considered. Nevertheless, in accordance with the requirements of article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in Chile, a child means every human being below the age of 18 years.

>46. As a result, there is currently a contradiction between the provisions of the Convention and those of civil law, in particular the Civil Code, which stipulates in article 26 that ""anyone who has not reached the age of seven shall be considered an infant or child; a male below the age of 14 and a female below the age of 12 shall be considered below the age of puberty; anyone over the age of puberty shall be considered an adult; a person who has reached the age of 21 shall be considered of age, or simply a major, and anyone who has not reached that age shall be considered below legal age, or simply a minor.""

Innovation occurs through competition and adaptation. If you can make a product that is cheaper and better than previous products you have the strongest chance of being successful. That‚Äôs economics 101, pal. Innovation, much like evolution, can be a slow and painful process. This is proven through facts on the ground.... I mean reality. This is why the United States out competed and outlasted the communist Soviet Union. This is why China turned away from their failed Marxist policies and adopted state capitalism. China realized that famine, poverty, and mass death were bad results. They adapted. 

Exploitation of workers occurs/ed in every undeveloped (by modern standards) country. Communist countries have always had much worse living standards for workers. When the value of a worker increases their living standards increase. Unfortunately, this is a fact of life that has never been avoided. In the United States every ethnic group you mentioned is doing better today than they‚Äôve ever done at any other time in history, and better than they‚Äôve ever done anywhere in the world. Every group you mentioned is a success story for capitalism.

The policy was for safety of the women there. They were accompanying me outside because I was in an unfamiliar country and could easily get lost or harmed - the women there liked to be accompanied as well, because with a man present they were generally safer (women together still quite vulnerable here). From my discussions with the women, many of the offices in this area had a similar system of shuttling them in/out and having a male escort when going out. It was standard as a precautionary measure. 

Not really sure where all these other assumptions are coming from or why you are 100% sure about the motivations of people you‚Äôve never met.

That is a statement of justification, though. ""Something would have beaten it by now"" does imply that its efficacy allows it to beat every other system, but that doesn't hold up when you look at history. It was incredibly dangerous to criticize capitalism in the US after WWII. There never has been a competition in the marketplace of ideas.

>Not a single intervention.

What about Chile? What about Vietnam?

>Consolidation of power is a problem by itself that has to be fixed via state.

Except this is all going exactly as predicted. Policies limiting private power were popular in the early 20th century. The idea of worker ownership was really popular after the industrial revolution among worker that didn't even know what socialism was. Normal people understood that the owners didn't have the best interests of workers at heart and their power in society was a detriment. Where are we in 2020 after decades of corporations owning every media product that people consume? Democratizing capitalism is an extremist position that will get you labeled a *marxist-leninist* by most people who consider themselves moderate. The state converting Amazon into a coop is considered tyrannical by most people, due to decades of propaganda that taught people to believe that you should thank your boss if you have a job and you should blame the government if you lose it(Anti-Politics).

>It's not ""infinite growth"" it's ""whatever growth we can get with the amount of wealth resources give us"".

And what we're headed for is a situation where all of these resources are owned by a few corporation. There can't be infinite growth, eventually there's no pie left and 99% of people are serfs."

For example, when you get in a cab, take a photo of the number plate of the can in such a way that the driver sees you taking it and sending to a friend over whatsapp. Typically that will keep the driver in good behaviour at all times."
1601850214.0|worldnews|HimalayanPunkSaltavl|"eh, I'm tired and depressed, and pounding out arguments about why capitalism is fucking stupid is exhausting. But if you want:

I'd like to suggest that 

>The global economy works the same way as evolution. It‚Äôs a constant competition. You adapt or you die. Those that adapt inevitably thrive. Capitalism is about adapting.

is just wildly incorrect. Capitalism isn't some sexy Darwinian only the canniest and best survive game. It's a game of exploitation. Capitalism hates innovation and only does so under great duress (look at medicine and energy for instance) although yeah you do see innovation in smaller scales like local food or entertainment(industries both known for their brutal exploitation of their workers)

Capitalism has *sometimes* been good for *some* people but only when it has TONS of brakes through regulation and unions. And even then was very bad for many many people(if you are American, see: black people, Italians, Irish, Germans, Women, people that didn't own land.. ect)  

I'd go on but my hungry man dinner is done so I'ma go eat that and watch the big bang theory or something but could you do everyone a favor and not use weird turns of phrases like this

Just like elephants, they're plentiful enough to be nuisance animals in some areas."
1601850209.0|worldnews|hanafraud|"Not op,but I‚Äôll give a generic example of African conservation through hunting. It‚Äôs obviously much more nuanced than this, but here is the summary. Hunter wants to kill an elephant. Hunter has to go through the government to purchase a tag. An elephant tag is somewhere between 100k-500k dollars (depending on where). That money is specifically allocated towards conservation of the species that the tag was bought for. Then, in many African countries, the hunter has to pay the land owner for the right to hunt his animals (in many African countries, land owners own the animals). Once the hunter has paid the land owner, and the conservation department, now the hunter has to hire a guide (10-100k dollars). Altogether, an elephant can cost a Hunter up to a million dollars, which in Africa is a significant part of their economy. 

But it‚Äôs more than just the money. In many parts of Africa, the land owners own all the animals on their land. These animals can be very harmful to plants and livestock on their land and can become a nuisance‚Äîone that is removed by poaching (to which the land owner will turn a blind eye towards) or poison (by the landowner himself). But, when the animals on their land become a source of income, all of the sudden the land owner *doesnt* want all the animals gone and will take great lengths to protect the animals from poachers, even going so far as to hire guards (note: further economic gain) 

So hunting as a form on conservation serves multiple purposes: first, it is a big economic contributor. People argue that sight seeing is a more substantial contributor, and they may be right, but often other things are not taken into account (land owner tags, taxidermy, guides, wildlife guards, housing, food, transportation, etc.)

Second, it provides incentives for land owners to actively resist poaching instead of turning a blind eye towards it. 

Third, very often the meat is not shipped home and is instead given to the villagers to eat. This may sound like wontan waste, but it is sometimes required to be this way by the government to feed their people.

Lastly, and this is a part that a lot of people have a hard time understanding, oftentimes hunters are huge proponents of the animals they hunt. They spread awareness, fund private conservation groups, donate time and money to projects, create media that further spreads awareness and love for these animals, and pay for activities such as sightseeing and safaris to view these animals when they‚Äôre not hunting them.

Edit: spelling. Also, sorry for the book‚Äôs worth of writing."

You want Americans to take that position but the adherence to short term profits and Keynesian economic theory have promoted the idea of increased educational costs for students to shoulder the burden of with no increase in the quality of education that they‚Äôre getting. They have to go through years of schooling and take loans with insane interest rates for the chance of entering a field, like the medical field for example, that has insane hours with little compensation outside of niche expert fields. You say them at we spend more on education than anyone else but that spending is not increasing the quality of education or the supplies given to the students, it‚Äôs only increasing the profits that these schools, administrations, and predatory loan companies increase. Now take that some mode of predatory profiteering and apply it to every sector of the economy.

Would it? To what I've heard, a large part of American Catholics are already on the fence regarding this Pope, deemed too liberal. If Catholics ignore most of what's in the Bible and still vote GOP, I think the words of the Pope himself won't carry much weight.

Imagine this: Team starts at their own 20. 1st down no gain. 2nd down no gain. 3rd down, 30-yd pass attempt, incomplete, but: PASS INTERFERENCE, DEFENSE, BALL PLACED AT SPOT OF THE FOUL. So now the team has the ball at the 50 from gaining absolutely no yards at all, just because the penalty ""placed the ball at the spot of the foul"".

Then from the 50: 1st down no gain, 2nd down no gain, 2rd down another 30-yd pass attempt, incomplete, but oh no PASS INTERFERENCE PLACE BALL AT SPOT OF FOUL. So now they have the ball at the 20-yd line from doing nothing at all, just riding 60 yards JUST from the penalties.

Now they have the ball at the 20. 1st down no gain 2nd down no gain 3rd down they attempt the endzone but OH NO PASS INTERFERENCE BALL PLACED AT ONE YARD LINE AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. So now they have the ball at the 1, from doing absolutely nothing at all, they just rode penalties to get there. Then they take 3 downs to punch in 1 yard and get a touchdown.

On the one hand, websites like Reddit and 4chan do represent the public and citing them for information regarding journalism is becoming more common.

On the other hand, they're letting redditors do the hard work of producing the content, then just picking the already voted cream of the crop and repackaging it with minimal effort.

Overall, fairly negative. But then again, there are youtube channels which consist of ""pretty girl, doing regular things and videoing it while occasionally talking about interesting things"" or ""gamer guy plays horror game and has massive overreactions to everything he sees"" which proceed to gets thousands of views daily.

So now they have the ball at the 1, from doing absolutely nothing at all, they just rode penalties to get there. Then they take 3 downs to punch in 1 yard and get a touchdown. From gaining a total of one yard and riding penalties to get literally all the rest of the yards.

How fucking STUPID is that? Fucking broken sport if this can happen."

1601864892.0|AskReddit|irsquareamads|I had a similar incident, but with my sister.   We were latch key kids (this was 1982) and I was around 12.  We were playing backyard football with our friends and I had the ball.  One of the other guys tackled me from behind and caused me to fumble.  As I was pushing off the ground to recover the ball, another friend jumped on it and my arm at the same time.  I heard the pop of my bone and felt the pain.  My sister, of course, insisted I was faking it and made me sit at the kitchen table until my parents got home from work, which was about 3 hours.  So my dad comes home and sees my arm about twice it's normal size and takes me to the hospital.  It was indeed broken and I got a free souvenir cast!  The fun part - the hospital was LITERALLY across the street from my house, you could see it out through the kitchen window.  Gotta love family.

I had to have a surgical kneecap realignment (also called tibial tubercle osteotomy and elevation).  The surgery went great and I was home within 3 days.   About 48 hours of being home I got thirsty and needed to go to the fridge.   The issue though is I'm the 2nd floor and the fridge is on the first.  But whatever,  I had crutches and I started making my way down the flight of stairs.   I made it about 4 steps down, when all of a sudden my cat flew right by my crutches and startled me.  I fell face forward down 24 steps and during the fall my legs bend completely back.  I heard this awful zipper noise from the leg which I come to find out was the staples (80 of them) ripping out of my surgical wound.   I completely black out on the bottom of the stairs and come to with my cat looking at me.   I have these immobilizers on my leg so I just compress the leg tighter and get up.   Again, thinking I didn't really screw my leg up.   I end up getting my drink and go back upstairs.   Not knowing how much damage I have done I lay down and take a nap.   About 2 hours after my mom wakes me up screaming and I look down and my stabilizer and bed completely red.  They call and ambulance who took me to the hospital and when I saw my Artho he said something I never heard another doctor say.  Are you a FUCKING IDIOT!  YOU ALMOST DIED TODAY!

Result - I ended up breaking 3 different areas including knee cap in half.  The zipper noise was actually all the stitches came out.   I also started getting and infection and almost like 2 pints of blood due to one of screws going into a vein or something.

Lesson learned?  Nothin, I was thirsty."

Because it's proven to be effective and I don't believe doctors that talk about demon sex in dreams and bleach. That isn't science, that isn't medicine. I also didn't need the media to tell me any of that, I have a memory, I remember how SARS put the world in panic mode for a minute way back when. Precaution should never be labeled as paranoia. Masks seem self explanatory, as most of Asia adopted their use during the afformentioned prequel epidemic. 

I'm not the brightest knife in the old toolbox, but I do have some common sense. It's not about control, the government gassing and beating its own citizens is about control. This is basic decency during a global pandemic. I also long ago moved past the whole conspiracy mindset. The world is a disorganized shitshow, most everyone's just grinding to get by, not everything is a fucking conspiracy. Yet the internet goes wild, calls it a plandemic, anti-maskers spread their disinformation across every social media platform, and can't seem to fathom the idea that they're protecting other people. Like *what the fuck, America.*

I see why psychologists said that people who refuse to wear masks exhibit signs of psychopathy or sociopathy. There's *no regard* for the well being of others, *whatsoever*. They think everyone's a sheep, which is a reg flag word in-and-of itself. It's some frightening delusional thinking. Hell, I know a person who has labeled everyone who wears masks as mentally ill. That shit stings like all hell. The world is burning and nobody seems to be able to muster a fuck."

1601864840.0|AskReddit|MeX1canBurrit0|Not neccesarily. This is why their is a food chain. Because different animals over power others but in the grand scheme of things that is what keeps the balance. If one animal was to have no real predator the scale would tip more towards one side and all would follow. Weak and defenseless is too subjective to generalize. For example worms thrive but they all  are weak and defenseless to virtually every creature, in comparision rats and mice would take over all the worms and they would cease to exist but hawks fly down and eat the rats and mice thus keeping balance so that way everything in this world lives and when its time is to die out it will do so when the conditions are right. A baby elephant is still a baby but has the power to stomp over and kill a human if it needed to. At some point when we were closely like apes even being an infant was hard but we had are advantages just like baby elephants do ,its why we have survived so long and haven't died out since or been over taken by another species. Its evolution.

1601864834.0|AskReddit|DrossDespondent|"Over 4,000 know religions, how can only one be correct? Yet, if I believed every story I heard, I wouldn't even be able to walk down the street without fear of the sky falling. You know, Jesus wasn't the only one who claimed to be the child of God. Jim Jones faked his ability to heal physical afflictions with faith alone, he claimed it was because he was the son of God. It ended in a litany of abuse and the mass suicide of numerous men, women, and children. That is not a unique story, it had happened before and it happened after. At some point, you have to realize that the stories were created out of self-interest. 

Furthermore, any God could only exist outside of all known laws of physics and chemistry. The first law of thermodynamics, the law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed - only converted from one form of energy to another. 

Early in the 20th¬†century,¬†Einstein¬†figured out that even¬†mass¬†is a form of energy (this is called¬†mass-energy equivalence). The amount of mass directly relates to the amount of energy, as determined by the most famous formula in physics: E=mc2. Yet, God is told to have created the world and man out of sheer willpower. He is always, He is whatever mass or energy he chooses to be. He exists outside of the system, perpetuated only by our magical thinking. 

There are very specific biological process in the brain that cause thought to occur. In order for your brain to think, you need nerve cells that can detect information about the outside world and can transmit that information to other nerve cells. It‚Äôs the transmission of information, the cells talking to each other, that‚Äôs the fundamental physical basis for how thinking works. When a single neuron fires, it is an isolated chemical blip. When many fire together, they form a¬†thought. By extension, the whole¬†brain¬†is also an¬†electrochemical¬†machine. The neurons are connected in enormous networks. The receiving neuron registers the chemical signal and converts it to a new electrical signal, which is computed in the neuron's central body. 

One to five minutes after death, the brain is hit by a process called terminal¬†spreading depolarization (SD) ‚Äì or, in less scientific terms, a ‚Äúbrain tsunami‚Äù. In its most basic form, this is a wave of neuron activity that starts in the deeper brain structures and radiates outwards, unlike the previous burst of neuron activity, which hits all areas of the brain simultaneously. Importantly, it signifies the breakdown of the brain‚Äôs electrochemicals (the substances responsible for keeping our neurons alive and functioning) and marks the point at which the capacity for brain function and awareness are lost.¬†

When brain activity has ceased, thought continuing to occur would defy the law of conservation of energy in both physics and chemistry. Meanwhile, the blood forms clots, the fat liquefies, and the corpse turns a lovely green color. All the while, the body‚Äôs enzymes continue to digest its own organs. Those without much fibrous content (such as the brain) will be the first to go. Those with more fiber (like the heart and uterus) will stick around longer. 

The rotting body is becoming a sweet home for flies, maggots, and other insects. ‚ÄúAlmost from the moment of death, or even before in some cases, flies will lay eggs on the body ‚Äì usually around the nose, mouth, and eyes, and maggots will hatch and begin¬†to consume the body,‚Äù Hamilton told IFLScience. By day seven, the greedy grubs are able to consume up to 60 percent of the corpse. 

As decomposition proceeds, anaerobic bacteria primarily within the intestinal tract, produce gases resulting in bloating followed by the purge of fluids and subsequent release of nutrients and microbes into the underlying soil. 

These processes of decomposition are the conservation of energy at work. The total energy remains constant, and is conserved over time. That is evident, at no point does your brain teleport to some mystical realm where you get everything you want. The biological processes in your brain, no longer have a place to occur. Just as a God has no system to support his ethereal existence. 

Furthermore and to quote Epicurus, ""Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"""

I could easily cherry pick cartoons and say that ""all dogs from old school cartoons are beagles"" and it would be just as true as what you said.

The only true statement you could make is that the dogs in two cartoons you could think of and another you couldn't were great Danes. that  would not be much of a statement, but it would be true.  They way you worded it is just plain false, there are many old school cartoons with many different breeds of dogs and great Danes are no more common than other breeds.

Your original statement:
The only cartoon dog from old school cartoons like The Jetsons, Scooby-Doo, Clifford, (one other old cartoon that ive forgotten now) that isn't a great dane is Clifford."

Oh also, a month beforehand, when we found out I had WPWS, I was rushed to the hospital for my heart rate being over 217 or something and all like 7 of the doctors with me in my hospital room loved me cause all I did was talk about how I'm happy to be missing classes and that I didn't do my geometry hw the night before.

My old doctor canceled the Synthroid completely after running all kinds of heart function tests (echocardiograms are really freaky to watch when your heart is literally skipping beats) and diagnosed V-fib made worse by stress and overmedication.  Oddly, blood tests a few months later showed all my thyroid markers as fine.  I guess the shock of too much Synthroid made the gland stop overproducing TSH- just had to scare the heck out of me to do it.

Now, I have a lot of the symptoms of hypothyroidism, but none of the markers in my blood.  So the doc just keeps checking whatever she can think of and I just make do."

Once everyone realized, they ran to her and the first thing she said after coming to was ‚Äúow, my back kinda hurts‚Äù. She just wanted to get up and stretch because she thought that was the problem so everyone held her down until the helicopter arrived. One of the guys taking down info during the ride told us that when he asked allowed to the others ‚Äúdoes anyone know this girl‚Äôs social?‚Äù, she lifted her head and correctly and casually gave the man the number, even while being severely concussed along with broken ribs, cracked vertebrae, and a punctured lung.

1601864655.0|AskReddit|Awesomejuggler20|I've been driving for about 4 and a half years and I drive daily so I do have a little experience. Use your turn signal EVERY SINGLE TIME you make a turn no matter what (yes this includes in a parking lot). It's illegal to not signal a turn. Your signal is there for a reason. Not for a decoration. It's my driving pet peeve when people don't signal. Especially if I'm behind them. Also, if you're turning left at a flashing green light.... Do NOT make your turn if the light is no longer flashing and there's oncoming traffic. Once the light goes green for the oncoming traffic, they have the right of way. Not you. Unless you have plenty of time to make your turn before the oncoming light turns green, don't make your turn. If I'm turning left at a flashing green light, doesn't matter if I'm in the intersection already or not, if my light stops flashing green and is just solid green, I will stop and yield to oncoming traffic even if they haven't started going yet. I'll stop in the middle of the intersection if I have to. Can't count the amount of times I've been cut off by driver's ignoring the fact my light went green and they just turn right in front of me as if they still have the flashing light. Happened twice this weekend actually. Once yesterday and once tonight. Last but not least.... If you're turning left at a solid green light and there's a vehicle in the oncoming lane turning right, the vehicle turning right has the right of way. Not you. Only time you would have the right of way is if your light was flashing green.

https://www.handicappedpets.com/blog/ivdd-in-dogs/

My statement wasn't meant to disparage corgis, but to say that short-legged dogs are definitely prone to certain illnesses. Dachshunds are the prime example of this.

I don't know about incidence of disease (of any kind) in corgis. I do think that when 1/4 of dogs is experiencing a certain problem (like dachshunds) you should seriously reconsider the continuation of the breed, especially when the traits causing the problem are largely present for the sake of aesthetics. (Dachshunds aren't actually hunting badgers any more.)

Personally, I think it would be nice if everyone stopped breeding dogs... but I understand that that's not really reasonable and that not all dog breeds are equally as unethical. Bulldogs, dachshunds, and cavalier spaniels are the worst offenders as far as I know."

The dachshunds you see today are the same as the ones that were hunting badgers. As I said in another comment, 20-25% of dachshunds develop IVDD, which leads to very painful spinal problems and possible paralysis. I highly doubt that was the case when they were still a working dog.

I'll also mention that I recently adopted (what appears to be) a dachshund mix from the local shelter. She's a wonderful animal, but I can't imagine why someone would support the continuation of a breed with such common, severe, and painful problems."

She rescues fawns from a variety of situations over the course of the spring and summer (stuck in a fence, mom hit by a car, improperly 'rescued' by people) and provides care for them at her barn. She is required to release them in the fall except late birthed fawns so she tranqs them and moves them to a more secluded area near her friend's property so they have a good chance of avoiding people and don't come back to her barn, and releases them together so they'll have a better chance of getting through the winter. This was her most recent release, I believe.

She has a few fawns she's been allowed to 'winter over', including one who's basically BFFs with a rabbit she nursed back to health. I've learned a lot from her posts about how to treat wildlife, and frankly a lot about how much time and effort is involved. She does a full-time job of this and doesn't get paid. A very cool lady."

You‚Äôve quite literally only been insulting me and others throughout this entire thread. You‚Äôve called many others and me ignorant, dumbasses, idiots, as well as more. As i said. You‚Äôre being downvoted because you‚Äôre *rude.* Not to mention that the article you posted isn‚Äôt correct nor does it have proper sources. Tickling allows a developing body to garner some sense of space, where their body is as well as more. It‚Äôs the reason why throwing your kid 10 feet into a lake is enjoyable and fun.

Don‚Äôt have insurance since I‚Äôm a renter... it‚Äôs possible my renter‚Äôs insurance is still active, since it was tied to my auto insurance, but I haven‚Äôt checked in a while.

The munchkin gene is dominant, so breeding them at all - inbred or not - has the same effect of creating more cats with harmful genetic defects just because we find it cute.

So yeah, to be precise inbreeding isn't the issue here but it has the exact same outcome as inbreeding pets for these kinds of traits."

I mean, as far as I know, it started like this.

but then human idiots thought that it is cute and bred these so-called munchkin cats on purpose. creating cats that lose so much mobility and vitality. and have serious health issues.

and people who think that this is cute are actively looking for this breed and create a demand. 

and now the munchkin cat is an official breed

yeay..."

So far.

>The munchkins are just a cruel joke, turning a sleek and athletic animal into a stubby waddling joke.

So, it's not their health that is your concern, only how well do they fit into your aesthetic preferences?"

It should be obvious they aren't part of the truss (if truss attic).

My attic has some loose 2x4s that the contractors have broken off that are now laying on the sheetrock.

Basically, at construction, the lazy builders put 2x4s connecting between the trusses (not at floor level), with many of the ""nails"" meant to hold them in actually not connecting the 2x4 to the truss(es).  So they come off, since they only had a nail barely caught in one place."

When you resume the video, you only get the video-resume single ad and skip the ad roll. Sometimes it takes two tries, but it works in less time than watching all their crappy ads. Previous versions had other tricks, too (using another app/locking your phone for a minute during the first ad, then coming back and letting it finish after the ad roll timer in the background expired, closing the app right as the loading wheel 'skipped' when switching to the ad roll then re-opening the app now that the ad roll bit was marked 'watched', etc. - and the exploits cycled depending on what oversight in the code was active that month). Another exploit right now while watching on 4G signal is repetedly pausing and force-playing with brief pauses while the ad roll is struggling to load. Once the video starts playing smooth (without auto-pausing), you can switch back to wifi and the ad roll won't play.

Jason thinks he doesn't belong in the Good Place any more than Elanor does, and they both take ethics class from Chidi to try to fit in."

If you must do attic work, the ""drywall"" that makes your ceiling is not fit for walking on. Ask anyone with family members with anger issues how easy it is to punch a hole through the drywall on your walls. To move in an attic you must move along the supporting joists that make up the actual structure of the house. These are two by fours, often buried under insulation.

There aren't very many good F2P games, though. If you can afford it, the best/cheapest option would be to get a Series S ($300), and subscribe to Gamepass Ultimate ($15/mo).

Sonic 06 was rushed by a whole year, and quite frankly Secret Rings can be considered worse, but even still Modern Sonic has recovered fairly well from those titles between Unleashed's daytime sections, Colors, Generations, even Lost World on Wii U maybe. Mania is Classic so that doesn't count. Forces.... was a stumbling point, I'll admit, but still, it's not awful. Boom wasn't even made by Sonic Team/DIMPS, that was Big Red Button and Sanzaru, and even then, Sanzaru's second Sonic Boom game fixed the issues of the first.

1601863758.0|gaming|HobbesTech|"I'M SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS!! Ever since the original mountain update where they made it so biomes can change on the vertical axis, I have been desperately hoping for this day to come. Sure it doesn't have everything I've been wanting, but this is still something to finally get me interested again!! 

What I had truly wanted was additional depth, a few more tiers of metals interspersed (along with maybe a higher ceiling and lower floor of ability/speed?), and much more unique and varied generation. If it was a lot deeper, the generation could even vary a lot more at the different depths. That would all truly make me jump back in.

Why is this important to me? Well, essentially all I do in minecraft is mine. I build a little house, I farm, I get animals, I go to the nether, sure. But 90% of my time is spent down in the mines, exploring caves, gathering materials, making little rest points. It's what is most fun to me. And sadly that loop hasn't changed almost at all since the day I started playing. Sure the underground generation changed a little once or twice, but that's it. In fact, a number of additions, such as hunger, actually made it worse, since it required me to not stay down as long, it interrupted my favorite part. Hence why I stopped right before hunger was added.

For the past few years I've mused jumping back into Minecraft, but the lack of anything meaningful (or at all) changing to what I like has prevented me. Now though?

Now with that change, now I (well, soon at least) will actually have to."

1601861499.0|gaming|densetsu86|"Well if he prefers playstation then you get him a ps5. 

I see people keep arguing for gamepass. While its (for now) good for players, Sony has a compelling enough competition to that. Psnow. 9.99 a month or $60 for the year. Add that

Psnow yearly + Ps+ yearly = 120. So 120 vs 180 from game pass. That's $60 cheaper and you get psnow for pc and playstation with ps+. Ps+ on ps5 gives you instant game collection and ps+ collection. 

Psnow is 1 price and includes the service for playstation and pc. For pc it's all streaming. For playstation you can stream or download. You also get access to 800+ games. Those games include ps2 on ps4 which can be downloaded or streamed. Ps3 which is streaming only. Ps4 which can both be streamed or downloaded.

Now current ps now does not support mobile device (there is no mention that this will not or will happen sometime down the road, it's just currently ps and pc). 

And the other difference is no day 1 games. 

So psnow has 800+ vs gamepass 300+. 

Psnow with ps+ is 120 yearly vs gamepass 180 a year.

Psnow no day 1 vs gamepass some day 1

Pc and ps included vs more expensive option only for pc and xbox.

Psnow can stream games to the playstation vs gamepass cannot stream to xbox. All games must be downloaded on xbox so you need the space.

Also psnow streaming is on par with gamepass. Since they both use azure. 

Psnow is in 19 countries and gamepass with streaming is in 22 without streaming in 46.

So both have their pros and cons. Both are good deals with amazing values."

1601861062.0|gaming|LarsAlexandersson|"Honestly there's no real reason, mostly that it's become randomly super popular among higher profile streamers/youtubers. Bringing a lot more attention to it.

The game is relatively old, coming out in 2018 and it's only like $6, and it's on Mobile for free but you can pay to upgrade it. The game is pretty fun, especially with friends for how simple it is.

If I'm not mistaken it's probably loosely based on an old Starcraft Custom map that was a ton of fun called Infection which had a similar concept."

We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music.

Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

> Sly & the Family Stone were an important and influential band from Vallejo, California, United States. Active from 1966 until 1975, the band was pivotal in the development of soul, funk and psychedelia. Headed by singer, songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist Sly Stone, and containing several of his family members and friends, the band was the first major American rock band to have an integrated lineup in both race and gender.

> Brothers Sly Stone and singer/guitarist Freddie Stone combined their bands (Sly & the Stoners and Freddie & the Stone Souls) at the end of 1966. Sly and Freddie Stone, trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, drummer Gregg Errico, saxophonist Jerry Martini, and bassist Larry Graham completed the original lineup; Sly and Freddie's sister, singer/keyboardist Rose Stone, joined within a year. This collective recorded five Top 10 hits and four groundbreaking albums, which greatly influenced the sound of American pop music, soul, R&B, funk, and hip hop music. In the preface of his 1998 book For the Record: Sly and the Family Stone: An Oral History, Joel Selvin sums up the importance of Sly & the Family Stone's influence on African American music by stating ""there are two types of black music: black music before Sly Stone, and black music after Sly Stone"". The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.
During the early 1970s, the band switched to a grittier funk sound, which was as influential on the music industry as their earlier work. The band began to fall apart during this period because of drug abuse and ego clashes; consequently, the fortunes and reliability of the band deteriorated, leading to its dissolution in 1975. Sly Stone continued to record albums and tour with a new rotating lineup under the ""Sly & the Family Stone"" name from 1975 to 1983. In 1987, Sly Stone was arrested and sentenced for cocaine use, after which he went into effective retirement.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

> Lead singer Jason DeVore has also released material as a solo artist.

> Authority Zero was started in 1994 when Bill Marcks met Jason DeVore at Westwood High School. Marcks didn't actually meet DeVore until the summer of 1995, until then Authority Zero consisted of two guitarists (Marcks & Jerry Douglas) and a drummer J.W. Gordon, all from Westwood. This trio put a few songs together without lyrics or basslines. When that summer rolled around, Douglas was expecting the yearly visit of his friend Jason DeVore, from Wyoming. Douglas introduced his long time friend and Marcks jokingly asked if he wanted to be their singer, soon later it was no joke.

> Marcks was impressed with DeVore's ability to ""write catchy songs in fifteen minutes with really sticky hooks"". The two quickly enlisted Jeremy Wood on bass. His experience with lead guitar and musical theory separated his bass playing from others'. Not just a ""follow along,"" his baselines were independent and yet fluid with the music. (Wood actually taught Marcks & Douglas how to play guitar). However, because of Gordon's commitment to the Air Force, his position as drummer soon had to be replaced. Fellow classmate, skateboarder, and drummer Daniel Garcia fit this empty stool like a missing puzzle piece. He brought a new charge and tempo that evolved Authority Zero's music into a faster, more complex, punk rock style. Eventually, however, differences and family obligations led to Garcia's exit from the group.

> Marcks, Douglas, DeVore, and Wood finally came upon Los Angeles native Jim Wilcox formerly of Welter/The New Militia who's tragic events ended the group, and he fittingly completed the Authority Zero's lineup. Later Douglas also left the group and joined the Air Force.

> After releasing a local EP that sold very well, Authority Zero released their debut album A Passage In Time in 2002 on Lava Records. The album featured a blend of genres including punk rock and reggae, with obvious Spanish and Portuguese influences. A Passage In Time included the hits ""One More Minute"" and ""Over Seasons"".

> The success of A Passage In Time propelled the band into new popularity. Authority Zero appeared on many tours, such as Warped Tour, the No Use for a Name/The Starting Line tour, and Sum 41's ""Sum on Your Face"". The band has also toured with the likes of Everclear, Guttermouth and H2O.

> In 2004, Authority Zero released Andiam√≥, again on Lava Records. ""Andiam√≥"" means literally ""We go"" in Italian, but can also be read as ""And I am Zero"", the title of their live DVD released following Andiam√≥. The album again featured a blend of genres and Spanish/Portuguese influences. Andiam√≥ is somewhat politically charged, evident in the songs ""Revolution"", ""A Thousand Years of War"", and the cover of the song ""Mexican Radio"", originally written by Wall of Voodoo (the version that appears on Andiam√≥ has lyric changes in order to make a statement against the 2003 invasion of Iraq). In the summer of 2006, Authority Zero released a live acoustic compilation album titled Rhythm and Booze on Suburban Noize Records.

> The band's next album, entitled 12:34 was released on January 30, 2007. The track ""Courage"" was released as a single. The band recently toured with Rehab on the ""Lack of Luxury"" 2007 tour. This album is the final one featuring Jeremy Wood on bass, who left Authority Zero in November 2006 due to personal differences within the band.

> On December 30th, 2008 Bill Marcks posted a blog on his MySpace stating he left the band to spend more time with his family and to focus 100 percent on his new band, Sanziggo.

> Jason DeVore has also been working on a side project called The Bollox, an Irish punk band he started with longtime friends.

> It has also been confirmed that Authority Zero is working on a new studio album to be released February of 2010.

> Dean ""DJ"" Farmer resigned as the bass player on July 20, 2009 citing personal, business, and creative differences.

> Jeremy Wood has rejoined Authority Zero as the bass player.

1601853337.0|Music|mangarooboo|There are fewer trains this time around, but they've always been grabby little bitches.
1601853334.0|Music|caligari87|"Honestly it wasn't typically meant to be ""enjoyed"" at least not in the conventional sense.

Punk back then was about rebellion, non-conformity, breaking down of power structures, etc. Often that included rejecting things like traditional musical structure and sounds. It's meant to be abrasive, rough, nasty, and hard to like. It's meant to shock, to make proper society gasp in horror at this monstrous affront to ""good taste"". Plus the fact that a lot of punk musicians didn't actually have much in the way of musical training or ability; a common trope was that ""all you need is three chords and the truth"".

Nowadays, ""punk"" as a genre has been mostly co-opted by commercial interests. Packaged and polished in a more accessible format, just edgy enough to be exciting but not so abrasive that it can't sell millions of albums with a catchy radio single. 

The counterculture, ironically, became the culture."

These ghouls have eroded democracy through donations, lobbying and joboffers to politiciand.

The new era of social capitalism MUST be one that seeks to abolish this separation of society into owners and producers. We, the producers, are the many, and if we all start seeing the oppression that this separation puts on us and join forces, they can never defeat us.

Idk I guess I just have an old spirit in me.


to be honest I‚Äôll try not to be rude about it and just give my opinion, I just don‚Äôt find them too useful, and the symptoms I‚Äôve seen of COVID just seem so similar to the Flu.

We don‚Äôt wear masks for the flu, why this, why didn‚Äôt we do this for Ebola or swine flu?

And sure, 200k people died, that is a lot, but the flu kills millions of people a year anyway, but that gets no recognition because it‚Äôs common.

Idk, I just don‚Äôt really think we should be so worried about corona because it‚Äôs just something, in my opinion, similar to the Flu, with very similar symptoms, maybe a few different but nothing life threatening.

Take it like this, my grandfather is 78, if he got the flu, he would have a small chance at dying, and it‚Äôs pretty much the exact same for corona, since someone on the Wall Street journal said that trump, who is in his 70‚Äôs, and is overweight, has a 4% chance of death, which isn‚Äôt that bad for how old he is and his health at the moment"

1601864815.0|pics|Mrrasta1|Got a story for you. Boeing and paint. My uncle was a master painter at Boeing for years and years when his supervisor came to him with a number one priority job. He needed three cruise missiles for Monday to show off to some Washington big shots. Senators and Pentagon dudes. He said point blank it wasn‚Äôt possible. The super said whatever it takes, get it done. OK uncle gets three shifts a day organized and away they go. It‚Äôs Friday and they have two and a half days to get the missiles ready. The paint has to be perfect. A couple of millimeters thickness on one side or the other can affect performance, but everybody pulled together with their best effort. Monday rolls around and the cruise missiles are waiting to be launched for the big shots. The first one looks good but starts to roll pretty bad so they blow it up. Number two is picture perfect. Number three starts to corkscrew wildly right after launch and has to be destoyed. Everyone shakes hands, job well done blah blah, and they head back to Washington. No one said a thing about it to my uncle or his crew.

Blaming him directly is a bit ridiculous, sure. But to say anything less than ""His policies and party handled this about as poorly as possible"" is a joke. He, and his demonization of science are to blame. He is the president. The leader of this nation. It IS his job to guide this country through times like this, and he has utterly and completely failed. 

And now he has the fucking virus."

1601864310.0|pics|wil318466|"I don't deny reality in the least bit, you simply don't understand how the world works and what is true or not.  It's blatantly obvious YOU are the one believing what you're told, not me.  I don't care what Trump says, I look at the actual data.  You think I blindly believe what any person in this world tells me without looking it up myself?  Only a fool does that. 

Firstly, you believe that all the data you are given is true by default, and that it can not possibly be incorrect or manipulated.  Secondly, you're talking in absolute numbers and not percentages, because the populations of the countries you are talking about are wildly different, which even a child would realize.  Thirdly, you are the one using the argument from authority, with your ""trust in the science"" bullshit, which is OBVIOUSLY wrong. 

Lets look at a few things logically here.  Why do you think deaths in the US were being reported in the begining then all of a sudden it was switched to infections?  Why did Sweden, which had no lockdown whatsoever, have a similar death/infection rate as countries that had total lockdowns?  Also, what is the actual survival rate of the virus, in each age category?

YOU are the one blindly believing what you're being told by people who have absolutely no clue what they are talking about.  YOU are the one who believes propaganda, who completely disregards people who disagree with you as being fanboys. 

I look at everything through a skeptical eye.  I don't believe a fucking thing unless Iook it up myself, and I've come to the conclusion that almost every story about this is completely backwards.

Believe what you want, it's your life.  But I think one day soon you'll realize that the stuff you believe in is absolutely wrong.

Have fun."

They are both part of what makes a person's identity -- nature and nurture combine to make us who we are. If someone has an awesome stepparent, they still may have information they want to find out from a biological parent such as health info, ethnicity, family history etc that a step parent simply can't provide them. Either way, the person that raises you and loves you will always be most important.

1601864147.0|pics|evangelion-unit-two|Sure we do. Pointing to the *even worse* things Trump does is just a very concise way of pointing out that the people criticizing Obama generally care more about partisanship than the issues they're actually criticizing. I would argue that the use of drone strikes overall isn't a terrible strategy. If you're committed to continuing to combat ISIS and not completely pulling out of the middle east (read: power vacuum), then you can either send in troops, convince regional powers to send in troops, or use drones. The first gets American soldiers killed, the second is politically complicated and probably not practical to make a reality, so why not go with drones?

2. The holding of political views that favor free enterprise, private ownership, and socially conservative ideas.

>Conservatism is merely against radical reform...its not regressivism. Building on the past more than starting from.scratch.

Conservatives will call the solution to any problem ""radical reform"" if it causes them to lose a single cent o or bear even the mildest inconvenience.

The simple fact of the matter is that the problems we face today have no solution in the past that birthed these problems.

>You need only see the overton window to see how close they really are. Its skewed WAYYYY to the right in the USA compared to the UK.

It doesn't matter how center demcrats are, conservatism is the enemy of progress."

Most of the GOP leadership on the national level did take it seriously in the beginning, especially considering they are in the vulnerable age group. The red states that locked down the way they did, they were trying to not destroy their economies, and the stimulus was bi partisan. 

The reason they want to ""liberate"" states, is because their economies have grinded to a halt and they're going to see worse results from the continuous lock downs. Also, PA's lock downs were recently ruled unconstitutional.

So, Trump isn't far right, nor has he pushed the party to the right. If he was far right he wouldn't have went with the bump stock ban, the stimulus package, or increase our deficit."

1601863548.0|pics|AutoModerator|"[Obviously all lives matter. No one said they didn't](https://i.imgur.com/UyCmhSx.png). However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

The GOP would have to nominate someone else, but with so little time to get their name on the ballot and so many votes already cast, it becuase almost impossible for Biden to lose. Trump's votes don't transfer to their new candidate. 

So Biden would basically win by default. With Trump dead the likelihood that his base would turn out for down ballot elections would probably go down I think. Resulting an incredibly large blue was across local, state and federal elections. 

But I don't fucking know, this is all uncharted waters. 2020 is a bitch."

>Trump on Wednesday revoked Section 3 of Executive Order 13732, which required the director of national intelligence or other official to obtain information on the number of U.S. strikes against terrorist targets outside¬†active combat zones.

>That order, which was signed by President Obama July 1, 2016, also required assessments of combatant and¬†non-combatant deaths¬†from those strikes, as well as the release of an unclassified summary of that information by May 1 of each year.

Although,

>‚ÄúIncluding a classified annex allows DoD to share information within the U.S. government, while limiting the ability of enemies to employ counter tactics and procedures to purposefully jeopardize civilian lives as a military tactic,‚Äù Tresch said.

I just meant to point out that being a Law Professor doesn't exclude you from making boneheaded decisions.

For example, the expansion of executive power under Bush should have been *immediately* rolled back under Obama. It's a major failure for someone who was intimately familiar with constitutional law, how important it is to the balance of powers, and how it could be abused in the wrong hands. Given that, one can assume he made a calculated decision to ignore the constitutional issues so that he could benefit from the same expanded powers."

I postulated that the real issue isn‚Äôt that either president used drone strikes, rather the fact that Obama was awarded a Nobel peace prize while maintaining a high degree of drone strikes. Now I hate to be degrading but it is *very* clear that you struggle to connect concepts so I will reiterate: for the *first* time in this thread I associated the fact that Obama won a Nobel peace prize while having a very high amount of drone strikes as being the main reason people took note of his apparent lack of peaceful activity, RATHER than the number itself AND (in case you didn‚Äôt know) Trump has NOT received a Nobel Peace Prize and so less scrutiny has been given to his number of drone strikes BECAUSE it was the hypocrisy of giving a peace prize to a president who bombed the Middle East flat that caught people‚Äôs attention, not the fact that he took action allowed to his office. 

I hope this helps because it can‚Äôt be worded any more clearly, I feel like the potato in my kitchen could grasp this concept, by this point -.-‚Äò have a nice night and great life, I hope you find a good way to enhance your cognitive abilities and critical thinking skills over the course of your life."

That's not the part that's supposed to be funny.

1601863604.0|science|Neolife|"Our approach would be an IM injection, though there are also approaches with an inhaled delivery, to coat the lungs with the nanobody and attack the virus prior to infection.

Monoclonal antibodies and nanobodies are actually quite similar to one another. While typical antibodies have a larger antibody-binding region and a constant region, nanobodies in their simplest form have just a small antibody-binding region and no constant region. There are also constructs that conjugate the antibody-binding region of the nanobody to the constant region from human or other mammalian antibodies, called Nb-hcAbs (for nanobody - heavy-chain antibodies), which act very similar to classical antibodies but can be more potent.

So to sum that up, I don't know of any active nanobody treatments for autoimmune disease, but the similarities between those monoclonal antibody drugs and nanobody-based drugs can be incredibly high, to the extent where it would be highly probable that a nanobody-based drug would be able to replicate or improve upon the effects of a mAb for most conditions, at least that's what I would theorize based on my experience."

1601863459.0|science|Wormsblink|"Pharma scientist here, although I do purification work instead of antibody design.

Antibodies are like legos, they can be built in many combinations to ‚Äúfit‚Äù the target biological substance. Binding critical proteins on the virus (like the spike protein it uses to enter cells) can ‚Äúblock‚Äù and disable it.

Nanobodies are like minimalist antibodies, they only contain the portion that binds. This is very useful since they will have a much smaller molecule which is more stable, causes less immune response and are excreted faster from the body. Also they can be produced in bacteria instead of mammal cells, which makes it far easier.

For the work in this paper (which I unfortunately can‚Äôt access), I believe they use phage display instead of an actual alpaca. Basically a huge amount of bacteriophages (viruses) are synthesized, then tested on the target protein. The protein coat around the virus allows it to possibly bind to the target protein if you‚Äôre lucky, but with millions - billions of different phases you‚Äôre likely to get a few hits. The bacteriophage with the best binding ability is identified, then sequenced to get the amino acid sequence.

The sequence can be used to construct antibodies, which the researchers can choose to use standard antibodies or in this case a nanobody from an alpaca. They just need to change the ‚Äúlego‚Äù pieces on the antibody to the sequence they got from phage display.

So theoretically, it should be possible to build the antibody / nanobody from any mammal, including mice and humans. It just happens that nanobodies are useful so they went with camelids, specifically alpacas."

1601860562.0|science|spamholderman|"[Scientists at the Free University of Brussels in 1989 looked at the immune system of dromedaries and discovered that in addition to regular antibodies they also have unique antibodies with only 2 duplicate heavy chains instead of 2 pairs of heavy and light chains.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy-chain_antibody) Normal 4 chain antibodies can each bind 2 antigens but the binding site is made up of both a heavy and a light chain, while the dromedary antibodies can bind antigens with just the heavy chain. From that they took the active antigen-blocking part of the heavy chain and cut off the rest to make an even smaller nanobody protein. They've been investigated for cancer research because the smaller nanobodies not only fit into more places, but they also can be easier to make since you only need 1 genetic sequence to make a fully functional nanobody.

As to why evolution has maintained the 4 chain version, it's because it increases the amount of variability possible. All proteins up to tertiary structure are single strings folded onto themselves, so having an entire separate protein join up(quaternary structure) to make a functional antibody allows for addition complexity without compromising stability, like making origami from 2 pieces of paper instead of 1."

Camelids (alpaca, llama, camels) have a subset of antibodies known as single-domain antibodies (or ""nanobodies""). These are basically just a heavy chain without an associated light chain or the Fc. Since it's just a smaller single chain, it's easier to isolate and refold (the ""can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria"" part of the title)."

Again, I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree that alcohol consumption during pregnancy should be discouraged and generally avoided, but (1) the evidence of negative birth outcomes resulting from alcohol consumption is scant, especially for low levels, and (2) one drink of a beverage not proven to cause adverse health effects should not be grounds for the state to take a mother‚Äôs child.

1601854905.0|science|SelarDorr|"the 3rd paper does not conclude that there is no association between 2 drinks/week and adverse outcomes.

"" Odds of small for gestational age (SGA) and preterm birth were higher  for babies whose mothers consumed up to 32‚Äâg/week versus none ""

The study doesn't have a small sample size. It is a meta analysis, that compiles and interprets the results of 26 studies and is also the most recent of the 3 publications.

it also does account for socioeconomic confouders, and also includes 5 mendelian randomization studies, in which the effect of confounders are minimal.

&#x200B;

The amount of studies for <2 drinks/week are far less than the amount of studies for larger rates of consumption, and the ones that qualified for the meta-analysis did not show significance at this consumption rate for measures other than SGA. this is why the authors conclude there isn't a lot of evidence for <32g/week"
1601854673.0|science|diglettdigyourself|"Yeah, I'm just pointing out that drinking in early pregnancy is likely extremely common given how we calculate it.  

Also--I am not an expert and am really just spitballing here, but for other factors we need to control for, I haven't seen too many bring up the mother's underlying health or if she has hormonal problems.  If you have underlying health problems that cause irregular periods, you might also find out later than those without that you're pregnant, which would also mean you stop drinking later."

1601854474.0|science|MeanEYE|"While I don't have medical degree, I can talk about RF penetration in regards to WIFI as I worked for some years on establishing few ISPs here that were solely based on long distance WIFI.

Basically, penetrating power of 2.4GHz is not that big and loses energy very fast. In our usage case we had couple of watts of emitting power with a very directional antenna and smaller tree would reduce reduce signal by a huge amount, almost 2/3 of it. Not very scientific but hear me out. So we used anywhere from 2W to 5W power to emit long distances. Common house-hold WIFI routers are usually around 100 or 150mW. Orders of magnitude lower power and therefore very bad penetration. Apply inverse square law and your power drops significantly at even one meter. Not to mention antennas on WIFI routers are omnidirectional antennas covering 360¬∞.

All that said, the higher you go in frequency lower the penetration power. At 5.8GHz penetration is significantly lower. Think about this in [sine waves](https://www.wifi-professionals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wave-length.png). In case of 5.8GHz signal has to travel longer though obstacle of same thickness.

---

So, inverse square law which is `i = 1 / r¬≤`. If 360¬∞ antenna has 100mW at source, some 36¬∞ which are pointing at you would have 10mW. That's at source (let's say 1cm). At one meter distance it would have been much much much lower than what they tested for, it would have been around 0.0001mW. For comparison, signal strength devices around your home are receiving are anywhere between -50dBm and -100dBm, or in mW 0.00001 and 0.0000000001 respectively. Very very very low as you can see."

All you are doing is distracting from the main point, which is capitalism has selected the already wealthy and powerful in a time of crisis, in favor of the majority of people.  And I will double down in saying yes, the continued process of selling more consumer goods at the expense of the nationals health is sickening.  That is totally exclusive from yes, I understand we all need to do things to pass the time and keep us sane, I certainly have and I would expect anyone to do the same, but it doesn't mean we need to put the nation at risk to continue the process.

You need to understand in one way or another that it's not politics, it's not the media, it's not stereotypes, it's not culture, and it's not people, islam is the problem. By islam, I mean the religion itself, the quran and hadiths, they are the problem. Just because you have no idea what they say that doesn't mean that I have a ""colored perception"".

> Regardless, the hysterical hostility is Islamophobic. 

This is another thing that you need to understand. There is no such thing as islamophobia. No matter how many times you say otherwise, there will never, ever be such a thing as a phobia of a religion, ever. This terms exists by extremist muslims for extremists muslims to shut down any criticism of this vile religion. Unfortunately for them and anyone who pushes for this ridiculous term, islam is not going to get a pass for blasphmey. It will get rightfully criticized.

> Islam is not any more dangerous than any other religion 

Again with fallacy, it's like you have nothing else to say. ""B... but what about other religions"" doesn't negate, justify, or excuse the shit that happens in islam. It's just whataboutism.

> People are religious because they have death anxiety and want something  to make their struggles easier. That is the primary function of  religion, not whatever else you have attached to it 

It's not me or anyone, you're the one who has this narrow ignorant view of what religion is. You don't understand it. Let me give you an example, in your view islam is some sort of harmless religion, well according to the scriptures themselves, you shouldn't exist. There are plenty of verses in the quran and plenty of sahih hadiths (which I can cite) that state that apostates like you should be hunted down and killed for leaving islam."

>Everyone taking home 1/2 million instead of the execs taking home 100 mill and the engineers taking home 100k would make the world a better place.

I don't fundamentally disagree. However, this disparity is

A) Rare. Find me a company with ""execs"" (multiple) taking home 8 figures each.

B) False for the vast majority of companies except for like, the few whales people always talk about as if they represent the entire economy and all the employees. In Apple's case your numbers are pretty much spot on (every employee could get \~500k if they distributed *all* profit equally). Most companies are nowhere near this. Do the math on a few. This kind of distribution amounts to jack shit for the vast, vast majority of companies from big to small.

>Our generation needs to start business that change the way the workforce is compensated.

I also don't disagree. I'll point out though, that there is literally nothing stopping you or anyone else from running a company this way.

When you go out for coffee, for example, you scan a government-supplied QR code which is displayed on the door of the business with the government's Covid-19 tracer app. The information is held on your phone, and then provided to the Ministry of Health contact tracer team if you ever need to be contacted.

Essentially the app and QR codes serve as a diary record of the places you visit, so that if in a week's time you are urgently called by the Ministry regarding a potential close contact with a Covid-19 positive case, you can give them precise details about the time and places you visited.

For those without devices able to scan QR codes, businesses must provide some alternative - normally this done by them asking you to sign in upon arrival, which takes longer, but earlier this month it was reported that more than 2.1 million people had downloaded the app."

Scientists generally agree we are living in the most critical time in human history, because humans have developed vast inequality and the capacity to destroy the planet through nuclear war and setting up unstoppable catastrophic climate change (see California).

We have a ways to go to get to the peace and harmony stage, and may not make it.  The so-called Aquarian Age symbolizes the possibility of a change, or mutation, in human consciousness, but the only pathway is through the dissolution (Aquarius) and destruction of obsolete structures, in society, religion/mythology and individual awareness.

We should note that we are leaving the Age of Pisces, which symbolizes male perfection (Jesus and all our gods and prophets) and moving into the age of perfected femininty (Mary Magdalene and #MeToo) and all the reckonings against male authority and domination.

We must learn to take care of our planet and co-species.  This is a feminine job though the guys could help a lot.  There's a lot at stake."

So you have all these individual but unspoken heterodoxies springing up from a deep-seated difference in cultural values.

USA interest is even more. Its not because of climate change or deforestation, it was always because of: 1. Good position for military bases; 2. Unprecedent economic exploration.

In Brazil, there's a long term discussion about international help being used as a precedent to crush it's sovereignty. And it's not a conspiracy theory. There are plenty of speeches coming from American, French and British leaders saying that amazon rainforest should be an international territory. I believe that's a necessary context to understand what happened.  

Bolsonaro is still a moron? Yes

He doesn't know how to handle internacional politics? Double yes 

But implying that throwing money over Brazil because we HAVE to solve a problem that is not an ""amazon rainforest problem"", but a ""global biomas"" problem, is, to be honest, quite disrespectful. It suggests that the whole responsability for solving climate change problem is on Brazil's shoulders.

Starting in the mid-80s with the first big wave of leveraged buy-outs, maximal shareholder value became gospel for Wall St bc of Harvard Business School professors preaching that a company investing its profits in the company was inherently much less efficient than disgorging those profits to its shareholders as quickly as possible. The idea behind this was that any good company can just cheaply borrow money to make internal investments and as such holding cash reserves or investing it in human resources from sources of profit was a misuse of that profit that devalued each dollar. Why invest $1 of profits in HR today when all it will get you is $0.05 in profit by the end of the year (even though it may profit $10 in 2 years) when you could just get a cheap loan and hire management consultants to insulate yourself from accountability for internal investments being mismanaged. Once that doctrine became gospel and globalization could hit formerly Communist markets, we started seeing many huge companies become gradually hollowed out, from Dell to GM.

As to it being a ""bribe"", I view it quite differently. Given Brazil's less than ideal treatment of the rainforests comes from their focus on economic interests and many wealthy countries also abused their environment back when they were industrializing, I see it as the wealthy countries trying to make it fair that they are telling Brazil not to treat they environment as they once did for profit.

As to you having no idea what Biden actually proposed, it doesn't surprise me that others have chosen to down vote since it goes over this stuff immediately in the article. Instead you are going to call Biden's plan idiotic when you haven't even made the smallest attempts to actually know what it is.

Finally, again I ask what are we supposed to do if not economically incentivise Brazil to do the right thing? I don't think it's reasonable to use military force and while culture is referenced as a source of power, I don't think a diss track is going to convince Brazil to change their actions."

That's a hard pill to swallow for a nation that has long been built on exceptionalism. Imagine how horribly the US would take it if they suddenly stopped being globally relevant and people considered Canada the real power on the continent. 

This level of exceptionalism is of course directly tied to nationalism and the two of course are not going to admit that the nation just isn't a global power anymore. Then you need a reason why they currently aren't a global power. Of course, nationalism means that you cannot blame anything about the nation itself for it, so you have to look outside. That's where the EU comes in.

Then you have the issue of momentum. It's great to tell your constituents that it's outside forces and not them that are to blame, and it is great to stoke their fervor, but what do you do when your actions that were mostly made to garner support start to culminate? You can't back down, that's out of the question, so you just hope the fervor isn't at the level where it'll show all your rhetoric to be the falsities they are."

They sing a song of protecting indigenous land, but that‚Äôs just a front. They have no interest in protecting the environment. The legislative is predominantly leans left. The left parties in Brazil are the personification of corruption. Since the end of military dictatorship, Brazil has had one president impeached and removed from office, one president that resigned to avoid impeachment, and a former president that was was convicted after he left office. To overcompensate the atrocities of the military dictatorship, Brazil has historically been a center left leaning country. However, extreme corruption has led Brazil to once again over compensate by electing a moron who refuses to accept science, right leaning asshat. Soccer and carnaval used to be Brazil‚Äôs figurative religions. Now politics has, like in the US, become a matter of faith too. People vote with their guts, not their heads, and their supported politician can do no wrong. For instance, the politician who broke ties with Bolsonaro after the military police scandal and who had a vital vote that helped impeach the former left wing president from the PT party, has been accused by Bolsonaro supporters of being a PT spy infiltrated into Bolsonaro‚Äôs cabinet in order to destroy Bolsonaro from within. It‚Äôs batshit crazy over there. More so than here in the US.

The real concern is often not online attacks and yes, these systems can prevent hundreds to millions of guesses needed to break in. But ultimately you need layered security, so that should include good passwords. My argument that this wouldn't have sufficient entropy still stands.

For example even in the case of WPA2 which was once reasonably secure my buddy is now cracking these with only a single sample to brute force. This wasn't intended possible in the protocol but eventually was.

This has other big impacts too like if a database with authentication information is leaked. People will grab the salted and or hashed passwords and user accounts and crack the hash, then start trying to authenticate with those credentials everywhere.

You acknowledge that this brute force hashing isn't applicable to a lot of systems with bottlenecks for auth attempts but still, a password being that insecure will have effects down the line if there's a protocol or implementation mistake. This is why you wouldn't want to use an eight digit PIN for accessing your bank, but that would be fundamentally safe if the login attempts are limited. Until of course it's not."

Testing in the community was certainly down during our 100+ day streak of zero community cases, however not enough that a completely different strain could develop and go unmissed.

We have heroines in media like Wonder Woman, Black Widow, and Captain Marvel that are held up on a pedistal as though it's indicative of 'how far we've come'. I mention comic movies because thanks to their recent success, they're the only ones that seem to get enough time discussed as examples on this topic. The real test will be if the overall makeup of stories and how female characters are used in telling them will shift in ten, twenty, or fifty years and if the changes stuck. The most recent film in my memory that I can recall that fits the idea of women seen as heroic or flawed as any male character was Annihilation. Maybe the opinions of Tolkien will change on the next LOTR telling without the manufactured Arwen romance distracting from the other more interesting female roles, or hopefully we see some of Galadriel (and other women) during the Silmarillion when she was more Warrior Queen in her prime, than the introspective, philosophical ruler of a waning power in LOTR.

The UK is not a one party state. Not now, not ever. I know people like you just love to act like we're in the end days, like you get off on it or something, but just give it a fucking rest will you?

""There will never be another Labour government""? Tony Blair took us into a war that we're still feeling the effects of, got reelected, and then Labour won *again* with Gordon Brown. Labour fucked up constantly and still got into government. No different to what's happening with the Conservatives now.

I'm sorry but you are absolutely fucking braindead if you think the Conservatives are now going to be some kind of eternal dictatorship or something. If Labour don't win the 2024 election, they'll win the 2029. You can quote me on it, and I'll give you ¬£5000.00 if they don't. Have me sign a fucking contract."

>countries are not afraid to bear higher costs, such as Trump's tariffs

Congrats, you just named the one economic policy that makes every economist in America afraid. If you talk to an economist, you'll notice that the word ""tariff"" is not a well-received one in their circles. The reason that China's exports were not affected is because they in fact changed very little and American consumers are the ones paying for it.

>It is not a given that China will export less

That's not the only thing that matters. China wants their stuff, and they want it cheap. If you restrict extraction of resources from the Amazon, one of those two will change. Simple economics.

>You should take responsibility for operationalizing your own variable

I did that on purpose. I brought up an issue, and I addressed it. If green tech wasn't better for future generations, there would not be countries out there desperate to curb it and scientists warning us to change our ways every two seconds."

Ellen Page.

Another that I would like to meet, and frankly that I would like to see more of (if you see what I mean): Maisie Williams. She's super cute, and she looks like someone fun to hang out with. Even if I could never ''get my way with her'', like Ellen Page, Just haging out would be fine for me.

My last celebreity crush would probably be Letitia. She's (IMO of course, feel free to disagree) one of the most attractive black actress. I never saw videos of her outside the Black Panther Movies, but given that she did appear in comicons, I guess she's well appreciated. So like Page and Williams, I don't think I could go that far (although I certainly wouldn't mind), meeting her in person and at least have a friendly date with her would make me happy."

Whatever agreements you have made with others are where the cheating comes in. Are you sharing something of yourself that you promised to only share with that one person. 

Now we're into the semantics of owning someone's sexual activity. ""Only I can have sex with my SO because they are mine."" It's a very standard concept. What it should be is ""Only I can have sex with my SO because that is what they promised to me."" As there is no ownership, just agreement. 

If the thing you are doing is outside the agreements you have made, then it is cheating. If the things you are doing are not disclosed, then there can be no agreement, so that it's deceit by omission. If the SO knows but doesn't like it, then it is their decision to continue or not, but the agreement is intact as everything is disclosed. If the SO knows and doesn't mind, then all good all round."

Yeah, I honestly didn't know what to believe about Johnny's innocence in the matter at the beginning either, but it's like a significant part of myself clearly stood up for him without any proof and serious knowledge of the events that led him to that situation. May have been hypocrite when stating that it was obvious he wouldn't resort to violence, but I'm pretty sure of it anyway. Do you happen to know what's the conclusion of the case?

First of all, only your first description is a genius.  Someone who accomplishes things through hard work and dedication could be a genius, or they might not be.  You‚Äôre describing conscientiousness, not intelligence.  Genius is high intelligence, nothing more or less.

Let‚Äôs stop using terms like genius for the finer part of this argument.  Genius typically is accepted to be 160 IQ.  This means you 4 standard deviations from the mean IQ.  3 standard deviations would make you smarter than 99.7% of people.  I‚Äôm not sure the exact math for 4 SDV, but it‚Äôs effectively 99.999%.  Putting you at one in 10,000.  Researchers who look at gifted children actually put true ‚Äúgenius‚Äù level IQ even higher to define that kid who graduates high school around age 13 and is capable of undergraduate level learning in his/her early teens.  They represent this individual as closer to 1 in 1 million.  

Anyway,  why am I talking about this?  Well everyone can‚Äôt do what that 1 in 1 million kid can do.  Everyone also can‚Äôt do what everyone who is a member of the Mensa or whatever it‚Äôs called genius registry at IQ 160.  It does not matter how much hard work you put in,  they will be able to accomplish things you do not have the ability to accomplish, period.  However these people are extremely rare.  Of them, many won‚Äôt reach their full potential anyway.  IQ is actually a rather crappy predictor of success after a certain point. 

Now let‚Äôs talk about more relevant levels of IQ.  Average IQ is 100.  68% of people fall between 85 and 115.  Somewhere between about 115 and 125, IQ stops predicting success.  

Let‚Äôs talk medical school because that is a widely known level of high academic achievement.  A person with an IQ of 115 can go to medical school and likely do fine. However, someone with an IQ of 100 is very unlikely to make it to this level of advanced education, and is very unlikely to do well.  Someone with an IQ of 85 would be very unlikely to complete an undergraduate curriculum in a hard science to even be eligible to apply to medical school.

Let‚Äôs go back to your argument now.  When we talk about that 115 individual, if they apply themself it is likely they can accomplish most things.  The only things that they might do well in would be extremely high level math and physics that require even higher IQ.  However it‚Äôs very unlikely they‚Äôd want to do that anyway.  Most other people are fairly limited by their Innate ability."
1601865801.0|AskReddit|daggerxdarling|"Thank you very much! Please do, I'm so glad you're able to. It always brings me joy to hear someone speak so lovingly of their children. I'm certain you're a fantastic parent.

Really? How does one go about helping with that? I wouldn't mind offering my story for that! It's not an easy job, the chance to help even a little and show their work will be appreciated no matter what sounds very fulfilling! I'd had a number of miscarriages before her, so that may help them understand a situation slightly more complicated in the grief department (if that makes any sense, all grief is valid and complicated). Come to think of it, that's probably why i was so adamant about getting the ""punchline"" asap. It was always an immediate answer prior - before i could even ask a question. The uncertainty was entirely new, especially for the one who finally ""made it,"" so to speak.

No heart attack, heart looked normal at the time. Nothing was showing up at the time. Asked about my life. I have 4 kids, homeschooling 2 of them, and was in the middle of helping to planning (someone else's) wedding. Turns out I was having an anxiety attack.

1601865766.0|AskReddit|Trumpet6789|"I love the good ones.

CueStar, AnotherXYZ, GioFilms, OneTopic, TheClick, Wonderstruck Guy and his crew, Ailiarus aka PANDA DADDY, SorrowTV, and *Fresh* are my favorites. They actually put quite a lot of work into their videos to make them stand out.

I love those guys, I started watching Fresh first, followed by Cue back in 2018. I was subbed to them when they made their 100 subscriber specials.

Next came AnotherXYZ and Ailiarus, about a month later. Wonderstruck came across my feed early 2019, about the same time I discovered GioFilms.

OneTopic is an extremely wholesome guy, I found him during this spring(2020), and he is good friends with TheClick, who I also subscribed to.

Many people have terrible presentation, not the best(if any) voice acting, and mill posts like crazy. Sorrow is taking a break right now, which makes me sad; but he'll be back and his videos are hysterical.

These guys have consistent upload schedules without being over the top. Gio, One Topic and TheClick have nearly everyday or everyday uploads. Wonderstruck does one a week I think? AnotherXYZ, Cue, Ailiarus, and Fresh have schedules that are seemingly random; however they put out decent length videos, that are high quality.

Fresh has to be my all time favorite. Not only for being the first Reddit reader I found, but because the quality of his videos are amazing. You can tell he puts hours into them, his sarcasm is unmatched and I love throwing on his videos even after the 10th time watching them."

There was suppose to be an option to opt out and parents could refuse the flouride treatments but we were forced by the teachers to take the tablets even if our parents didnt sign the waivers giving permission. Wed get recess or lunch taken away and some of the teachers would shove the tablets in our mouths by force. 

A lot of parents were really pissed about it but nothing really changed and we were all just sorta forced to take the fluoride. I have permenant white spots/streaks on all of my teeth as a result of it.

Each teacher had a big pill bottled full of small white unmarked fluoride tablets and would walk around the room every morning giving the tablets. 

That principal was ""forcefully retired"" when i was in 6th grade due to child abuse claims. We left the school after that so I don't know if the fluoride thing continued with the new principle or not."

It doesn't take much of this before someone feels like they've been wronged by another person or group. often whether they admit it or not people will deliberately chose actions that put them at an advantage rather than level the playing field. Being on top is a higher priority than being fair.

Turned out I had 3 bigass pulmonary embolisms, which explained why I felt like I was half dead.  That was free - just walk out and say thanks.

Canada's health care system is backed way the fuck up... there are systemic reasons for it.  To name a few, underpayed doctors (kind of like sports teams, why the fuck would you play for a Canadian team when an American team will pay you twice as much), understaffed facilities, and the one you're going for... too many people using the system.

On one hand, if you need it, you should use it.  On the other, when people are going to the emergency room for a fever (literally, every time I can remember being there I've heard the doctor explaining to someone their non-emergency condition).

They use it, because the GPs are all busy and not taking new patients.

Do I like the system?  No.  But about the only thing I'd do is add a co-pay for *electives* and non-emergency (at hospitals) to dissuade abuse of the system."

1601865680.0|AskReddit|bigthama|"No it is not. That's not even close to being the definition of homeopathy.

Homeopathy at its core is the belief that ""like cures like"" as claimed by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century. This was in contrast to allopathy, the idea that effective treatments for disease would likely not be made from the same type of thing as the disease itself. 

Homeopaths believe that by diluting a substance you make it more powerful. Thus, to treat arsenic poisoning, an extremely dilute arsenic solution might be used. The number of dilutions used by modern homeopaths result in solutions where it is statistically improbable for even a single molecule of the treatment to remain. The homeopathic response to this is that ""water has memory"" and retains therapeutic properties of substances even after they are no longer in solution. The implications of this for sewage treatment aside, this means that homeopathic remedies are implausible with respect to basic laws of physics, chemistry, and biology.

Unless this person was receiving 6C dilutions of spiderwebs, then their treatment was not homeopathic. 

Natural remedies are not necessarily homeopathic, and homeopathic remedies are not necessarily natural. Traditional remedies predate homeopathy by millenia, such as traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine. Mainstream, science-based medicine makes use of natural remedies and medicines based on natural remedies all the time. I regularly prescribe aspirin, which is derived from a traditional bark remedy. Penicillin is a natural remedy derived from mold. The only thing that makes these natural, traditional remedies part of mainstream medicine is that science has proven their effectiveness."

I don't wish for Trump to die....I wish him a long painful recovery that leaves him in a debilitating condition.

1601865646.0|AskReddit|RangerSkip|Religion is good for developing your moral compass. Whether you believe or not is a question of faith. I don't think we are supposed to **know**. If we did it wouldn't require faith on our part. Some people have faith that there's someone watching out for them. I can see the comfort in that, but at the end of the day, the new testament is a story about a man doing some good in the world. If you look at it like any work of fiction, there are definite lessons there.

If you want an anime that has concluded, Fullmetal Alchemist should be in your top choices. And AOT is ending soon, it's an amazing anime.

My Hero Academia was pretty much my first anime (Except Bakugan lol) but it's nowhere near wrapping up and the fanbase is...bad. But the plot is easy to understand and it's overall an amazing anime, it's just absurdly overhyped."

1601865522.0|AskReddit|404__LostAngeles|"Do you honestly believe the only thing you need to worry about is whether your skin is moisturized or not? Like what if people have acne and want to treat it? Should they do nothing? I'm honestly confused about your beliefs. Are you just anti-corporate and believe all the research done on skincare products is fake and they're just trying to sell us stuff? Or do you think humans should live as naturally as possible, without the aid of any products? I'm genuinely curious.

Also, I never said signs of aging are unnatural or unsightly. Obviously as we age our skin will show signs of it, but there's nothing wrong with trying to slow this process. You act like caring about your appearance is somehow a bad thing. Taking care of my skin is just another part of my daily hygiene routine, same as taking a shower and brushing my teeth. Also, it's a fact that UV rays cause damage to your skin and increase your risk of cancer, so to say that you don't require sunscreen is **you** not facing reality. I'm not sure why your response is so hostile, I was never trying to push anything on you, just making a suggestion. Do you also not shampoo or use soap? I mean, those aren't exactly ""natural,"" but they sure do help with keeping clean."

1601865908.0|aww|Kalooeh|"I had a Skookum, which is a Munchkin and a La Perm mix. Guy lived to be 18 years. Biggest health problem was he couldn't have cat food with grain in it and that's not even an uncommon problem with cats in general. Really he had no mobility issues and he even one managed to rebound off the couch and right over my head onto a chair, then take off through the house during a zoomies. Often up in one of the cat trees, on the back off the couch, of jumping up onto places with the other cats. 

Outweighed all the other cats too and Rocko was solid as hell with all the muscle to him. With his size, and short front legs and long hair he actually looked somewhat like a raccoon because just this stocky weird shaped cat. Didn't growl either, just made a huffing noise at the other cats (like hffhffhffhfffhff)

No problems with his back or legs. I had a regular cat that's back kind of sank as she aged but her AND her brother also ended up with sinus and mouth/throat cancer, along with other health problems. 

The thing is that Munchkins have been confirmed to not have specific health problems that aren't really breed specific since other breeds can have health conditions show up like with their backs, but people keep clinging to the old shit from people like Peta and the Dodo that because they have this look that they must be unhealthy.

The biggest problem for the breed really is the gene for it is dominant and can't breed two short-dominants together.

1601865895.0|aww|RiposteHatesYou|"Dachshunds have an extended back though, corgis do not. The issue comes from increased impact from the short legs, but has nothing to do with their actual spine. However, as long as you take care of your corgis and don't let them jump from high places, they are fine. I've got 2 of them. 

I agree that breeds that have horrible health problems right from the get go, like bulldogs can barely breathe right from birth. I think ""tea cup"" versions are the worst though, and are normally straight from inbreeding. Anyone who buys a tea cup Chihuahua is an asshole as far as I'm concerned."

1601865753.0|funny|DankMemes148|"Disclaimer: not a medical professional.

They use local anesthesia no matter what to ensure that the patient doesn‚Äôt feel pain, but dentist also might use IV sedation for wisdom teeth (drugs that make the patient really loopy and unable to remember most of the removal, but not completely unconscious) to make sure that the patient is comfortable during the removal so that the oral surgeon can do what they need to.  Even if the patient is unable to feel pain while getting their wisdom teeth removed because of local anesthesia, the process of the wisdom teeth being crushed and yanked out will probably still feel pretty uncomfortable, and could terrify the patient.  IV sedation should allow the patient to remain calm through the course of the removal to let the oral surgeon do their work.  Whether or not IV sedation should be used would also probably depend on the severity of the wisdom teeth removal: some people need 2 removed, some all 4, some people‚Äôs wisdom teeth are really stuck and need to be yanked out extremely forcefully, others are easier to get out.   

So while IV sedation isn‚Äôt required (in most cases at least) and the patient doesn‚Äôt have to use it if they absolutely don‚Äôt want to, you could see why a lot of oral surgeons would recommend some form of IV sedation to be used along with local anesthesia during the procedure."

First off, this is a really old comic and if you don't know it well, you don't know this is typical of Calvin's Dad and is part of the humor of the strip.  It's actually a very fun, funny, hilarious strip about an awesome kid.

Secondly, if you're not well over 40 this won't make as much sense to you, in my opinion.  I'm 48 and (sometimes) I feel guilty for just being outside for no reason.  Take a walk down the road, or in the woods, have a smoke, look around, spend time with just me and myself.  It's awesome but I think a lot of cultures look down on adults for ""doing nothing"".  When actually you're doing one of the best things you can:  relaxing and recharging without sleeping!

But some of us have allowed ourselves to live so long going by societal expectations that you should always be busy ""doing"" something that yes, it's rough at first when you decide that is NOT the way you have to live.  Guilt can be a very hard habit to break."

RDR2 was on Game Pass for 4 months, so that's like $40-$60 if you just wanted to play that game, and you don't even get to keep it!

Of course, the Game Pass library is big, so there's a variety of games to play, but, honestly, I don't even have time for all the games on Stadia at the moment.

It's a drive-in chain throughout the United States, and I think Canada. A drive-in is different from a drive-through in that you park in a spot and the food is brought out to your car instead of you pulling up to a window. You order over an intercom you initiate with a red button.

They used to wear roller skates, but they don't anymore.

They sell products in these categories: burgers, chicken, hot dog, ice cream, drink fountain, custom drinks, milkshakes, bagged ice, and gallon tea. They also default to take tots instead of french fries, and their tots are better than their fries. They also have onion rings.

Their commercials are stupid, typically with two guys in a parking spot waiting on their food and saying moronic things. [here you go.](https://youtu.be/yV7B3XyrfGs)

I still stand by what I said about disagreement. I think a discussion can be had with anyone even if there is a disagreement because it gives you insight into how the other person thinks. And that is infinitely better than 'agreeing to disagree' or anything else, imo. 

I was in your spot a few years back when the pronoun debacle was in the limelight. My mum's an English teacher and so grammar was knocked into my head from an early age. And my native language has a similar situation to English with no gender neutral pronouns. 

I hope my comments help you understand why people seem to refuse to budge on the usage of 'they' and I do hope I didn't seem patronising or sanctimonious in my comments. I was only trying to say what I've heard from people and friends who are NB or trans and my own opinions. I hope you have a lovely rest of the day/night. Stay safe!"

keynote0 is claiming that while the image is funny it does not belong on this subreddit because it's not a picture (""pic"" is short for the word ""picture"").

>""Um, yes it is?"" - Rivent

Rivent is claiming that it is a picture. Further implication is that it does belong on this subreddit.

>""It's an image not a picture."" - Me

I am making the argument that ""picture"" in the context of this subreddit is something that has been taken by a camera and is largely unedited. This is a photoshopped joke/image and not really appropriate for this subreddit. It belongs in /r/funny or /r/politicalhumor. Furthermore, I would argue that this violates at least the spirit of Rule 1B, even though there is no text.

Noun 

1. Commitment to traditional values and ideas with opposition to change or innovation.  

2. The holding of political views that favor free enterprise, private ownership, and socially conservative ideas.

You can't tear down the past, it's the past, it's being replaced with the future whether conservatives like it or not - and any institution that causes problems in society should be replaced as well, there is no reason to ""believe"" in institutions that don't serve the people who fund them."

Considering Vice has never been a right-wing rag, I think its safe to say the other founders were not similar to Mcinnes.  If Hitler had founded a mag with 2 other people and nary a word about the Jews being the death of Germany, its safe to say Hitler was irrelevant in editorial content.  You're trying to argue that the principle founder and leader of a political activist group who recruits his own members is immaterial to the group's actions, statements, and presence in the political sphere.  I don't know how much more dense that can get.

The organizers, the proud boys members who have been initiated, carry the confederate flag.  Shit, the proud boys have more strict organization than BLM does, it isn't some rag tag right wing equivalent of Antifa.  They even have uniforms for fuck's sake.  In all this time, how have you been completely oblivious to the proud boys and how have you not bothered to do your own research on them?  In 4 years they've existed, they've been quite busy."

Smell supposedly is the sense with the strongest memory. One time when I was on the UofM twin cities campus and had to use the bathroom I went to the basement of Kolthoff Hall to use that one. The soap in the dispenser was the same smell of the soap that I had in kindergarten. And that realization happened instantly. I don't remember a ton of things from childhood so this lightning strike was insane. That was the only bathroom that I ever found on campus that had that soap."

1601865292.0|pics|jlharper|"To anyone who is looking for a window into how these hate-based white supremacist groups manage to recruit new members, this is all you need to see. Notice the rebranding of 'hating others' as 'West is Best'. Rather than 'Right to incite hatred and commit assault on minorities' they say 'anti political correctness'. Notice how they want to put women back in the kitchen, but they frame it as 'venerating the housewife'.

Through careful marketing and manipulation of reality (literal fake news) they are able to hide their hate and bigotry behind a thin curtain of a 'pro male' agenda. They do not 'support men'. They ***do no***t donate to men's rights organizations or try to endorse pro-male legislation, or help to educate young men to help them achieve more in their life.

What they do is verbally, mentally and physically attack those who do not fit their narrow definition of the ideal man, which is a white, western male. That is because they are a hate group who is pro white male and anti everyone else.

It is likely this person is a member of the proud boys but distances himself from the group while sharing their recruitment message, portraying himself as a neutral third party rather than a recruiter to seem unbiased. It is an age old tactic. He will also be a racist, a white supremacist, a republican party conservative and a Trump supporter, but would potentially even deny all of the above when called out as such."

1601865921.0|worldnews|ParkJiSung777|">Biden's intention to end up offering $20 billion to address keeping the Amazon safe is a very different scale and focus than what you are attempting to claim is the same move.

Different scale but money itself isn't going to make the current Brazilian administration agree with us.

>I see it as the wealthy countries trying to make it fair that they are telling Brazil not to treat they environment as they once did for profit.

Sure that's a fair interpretation as well but again, that's not going to change the effectiveness of his plan.

>As to you having no idea what Biden actually proposed, it doesn't surprise me that others have chosen to down vote since it goes over this stuff immediately in the article.

He's very vague, probably purposefully. What does ""countries of the world mean""? Does that mean large Brazilian trade partners like China? If so, how he's going to get them on board since they have no incentive. Asking these questions show that Biden's plan is almost illogical.

>Finally, again I ask what are we supposed to do if not economically incentivise Brazil to do the right thing? I don't think it's reasonable to use military force and while culture is referenced as a source of power, I don't think a diss track is going to convince Brazil to change their actions.

Diplomatic force from regional actors is what's important. Empowering relevant local actors in the Amazon is important. All of those don't require giving $20 billion and is probably more effective."

Actually it isn't.  If you have a question about a position you should ask and clarify it rather than assume and be incorrect.  That is the most basic step you could possibly take.  It isn't correct to assume that someone is rooting for some team just because you may be.

What you hit on is much closer to my position which is there are definitely things capitalism does to benefit us, and I would even go so far as to say it's sort of intrinsic to life in general, it doesn't account for the fact it has to be modified in order to get better results.

It is not easy hunting, and any hunter will tell you that there is a mutual respect that is grown when tracking an animal. That sustinance you are gaining is far better than the horrors of factory farming or the death the animal will face in the wild.

People need to stop being ignorant to where food comes from, and the fact that we as humans are not above the food chain, we are a part of it. Few people bring a ""trophy"" home with I'll thoughts of what they have achieved. On the contrary, every hunter learns to respect the animal that gave its life for their sustinance and to use as much of the animal as possible in order to be respectful to the animal and not wasteful.

\+ He thought if he can unify the poor people he would take over the country

\+ In the very beginning, Mao didn't agree with the maxim because at that time China had no industry.  There was no concept like production & productivity measurement. 

\+ Once a bloke told him that these poor people need some similarity in paper. Perhaps maxims could be useful because it talked about poor people in Europe as well.

E.g, if I walk into McDonald's, I scan the QR code at the entrance. It'll be stored as ""McDonald's Joseph St, 2:24pm October 3rd"". I can then look through the app to view a diary of where I've been and when."

1601865219.0|worldnews|stupidlatentnothing|Exactly, this should have been a collaborative effort of many countries offering up money that would actually come close to rivalling the business value of those rainforests. Really though, the only thing that's going to stop the greed of these terrible men is for altruistic people to step up and demand them to stop.
1601865214.0|worldnews|Kanexan|Actually, to some degree kinda they do. Catholic Social Teaching disagrees strongly with socialism from a Marxist perspective‚Äîprimarily because Catholicism believes in private property and disagrees with the concept of class warfare‚Äîbut also has serious issues with the historical inequality and oppression under capitalism. There's no defined position beyond that; you have Dorothy Day on one end of the Catholic political spectrum and G.K. Chesterton on the other, both Catholics in good standing. Probably the closest explanation of the Church's ideal economy would be some flavor or combination of Syndicalism or Corporatism.
1601865209.0|worldnews|jesushoofes|"That's actually not true, the class action lawsuit was mainly that Red Bull advertised giving misleadingly high levels of energy, concentration, or vitality, when it had no scientific basis for such claims.

Normally they are displayed on the front door/window of a business to be scanned before you walk in, or just inside at a desk with hand sanitizer and a book that you can sign if you don't have your phone/can't use the app. Then, should a positive case be discovered, the Ministry of Health will seek out those who were at that location at the same time and thereafter for further contact tracing.

It's literally a national security crisis, unlike this country has ever seen.

All from one wildly irresponsible gathering of hundreds of shoulder-to-shoulder maskless idiots cheering the rushed appointment of a Supreme Court Justice who will help fuck up healthcare.

But all is good, The President is currently hopped up on steroids taking joy-rides with his Secret Service (obviously they now have to quarantine for 14-days or, you know.. suffer horrible health effects as well)

He's trying to push to ""get back to work"" at the White House by tomorrow, despite being roughly 5-6 days into a virus that peaks around day 7-10, and can last weeks or months. He will also be on steroids and meds, for at least several days, that can severely affect judgment while he attempts to lead the country and has the nuclear codes.

Oh, and the White House just put out [$100 commemorative coins](https://www.whitehousegiftshop.com/product-p/trump-defeats-covid.htm) saying ""Donald Trump Beats Covid!""

However, when Brazil says no, you still have the power to add more trees and start to make a dent in a world that is greatly in need of more trees.

The point is, that money can still be put to good use that helps the environment.
