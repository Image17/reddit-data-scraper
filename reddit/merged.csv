I would draw the line to only prohibit identity-based criticism that's directed at a specific person.  For example, saying ""Islam is a stupid religion"" should be fine, but not saying ""you're a stupid muslim"".  A particular identity should never be the determining factor.  It should only matter whether or not someone is attacked directly, regardless of what they are attacked for."

You said it was ""when one puts their own race first"". That's not supremacy. Hording power? Okay, maybe. But not caring more about your own race than other people. For example, if you had two buttons in front of you and you were forced to press one, one killed 10 Indians and the other killed 10 white people (or whatever you are), you would obviously press the latter. 

It is not supremacy for *any race* to care more about their own more than others. That's just kinship. Supremacy is thinking you are superior to all in virtually every aspect, which I know white people are not (i.e. eastern Asians have a higher IQ)"

I agree about the tribalism; the problem is that we don't understand quite how human consciousness looks like or what the data we're basing our truths off of comes from.                

It is absolutely supremacy when one group hordes all the power.

1599331285.0|announcements|TheGeorgiaGazette|"I've been addicted to this thread for the last 6 hours straight.   


I own a large news organization in the state of Georgia. We run (ran) 25 Facebook pages, one for each county we cover. We mainly focus on crime, posting mugshots, police reports, body cam footage, court records, etc.   


We were up to about 400 posts per day, spread out across all of our pages, when Facebook started disabling our admin accounts for ""posting too much"", regardless of how much our followers enjoyed the content.  


I made the difficult decision to transition all pages (and future pages) to Reddit. I found out quickly that I could only create so many subreddits at a time - I'm currently in ""Subreddit jail"" for the next 3 days ;)   


However, reading this thread gives me hope that moving to Reddit will ultimately be the right choice. I invested a lot into Facebook, and it's really sad what they have become, but my followers and I agree that this is the right decision. Thank you, u/spez, for being so vocal - regardless of whether the response is positive or not.   


My one major disappointment is that I can't seem to target cities using Reddit Ads. I can only target the state as a whole. There are a lot of areas we don't cover, and I feel like targeting the entire state wouldn't be very cost-effective.  


Here's to many more 'cake days'..."

Please listen to your users one more time and remove all these useless things. I'm really glad you listened to us and removed profile pics in comments, that was great! Please do it one more time and shut 86 useless rewards down. 

We don't need another Facebook where you can like the post jn 100 different ways. This is Reddit. I loved it in the way it used to be. Please save its glorious and remove all this useless stuff.

Well, I understand that you need money. Instead of making different awards you can improve Gold and Platinum ones. As example, I would suggest making Gold and Platinum holders able to personalize their Reddit appearance. Change colours of the page, font, links and they are the only ones who can see it, you know, everyone loves customisation.

Bitrue is upgrading its Financial Services by embracing the advantages of DeFi 
- We'll become a hybrid exchange, with CeFi and DeFi products
- Bitrue CeFi includes investment products Power Piggy and Lockups, and collateralized loan product
- The first DeFi service will be a peer-to-peer matching engine connecting borrowers and lenders. For better transparency, Bitrue will also be implementing upgrades to their existing CeFi services, starting with a move to make publicly viewable the wallets that contain the funds involved in loans.
- We're launching a token to power the upgraded Bitrue Financial Services - Bitrue Finance Token (BFT). The token will be distributed to Bitrue users starting this week and listed in mid-September.

I'm not ""left"" or ""right"". I agree and disagree with things from both sides. I cherry pick because I have my own mind. No one will put me in a box. Leftists hate me because I hate the victim mentality and I'm honest, those from the right hate me because I don't believe in god or care about being a traditional family man. 

However, there is one thing about the right that I like that the left doesn't have, and that is: most of the time you can have a discussion with them without getting cancelled, censored, insulted or dehumanized. Almost all the time you try this with the left... well, you're just not considered a human with feelings anymore. You're a monster, your life should be ruined, hate, hate hate. No good intentions to be seen towards another fellow human.

Censoring is truly the easiest way of winning. No one can call you out if they can't speak, right? If you think someone is wrong let them speak and make an idiot of themselves. Believing you are the arbiter of truth is the ultimate form of arrogance. 

The excuse of ""hate speech"" will never work. First, because I am convinced people from both sides spewed hate. So you should then ban a lot more leftist subreddits, including the leftist equivalent of The_Donald. Second, there will always be people who feel offended by what someone says. The only question is how many. And to base morality on numbers is really not moral."

My stance is that only an individual themselves has the right to decide whether or not they grant another person consent, yet. Radical, I know, but it's understandable you'd have that reaction given the many times you've established how little you think of a woman's cognitive capabilities.

> ""Some women really like to be raped, meaning that although she is consenting and therefore is not really a rape, everything else is exactly the same : the guy wants to rape her, she struggles, he does it anyway, he thinks he raped her, but she actually loved it. It's her kink, she thinks that since he risked prison to rape her, he really must have wanted her, which is exactly what she wants and her wants are very valid"".

This has nothing to do with what I said. A woman can be capable of giving consent without it meaning that *any time* she engages in sexual activity it is consensual. If a woman doesn't want to have sex there is no consent, plain and simple. If a man has sex with a woman that is protesting - verbally or physically - or that hasn't granted him consent then that is rape, there is no presumed consent that comes with a woman being capable of giving consent.

For example, we recognize that children aren't capable of consenting to sex. If a 30 year old man rapes a 10 year old girl even if she said it was okay that doesn't mean it was - this is because the child lacks the proper understanding of the weight of the decision she is making, she isn't aware of the possible ramifications for her decision, and because the man as an adult is in a position of power to manipulate and expose the child's vulnerability. A 30 year old woman is capable of giving consent to that same 30 year old man, but she is just as capable of revoking consent. Her simply having the mental capacity and understanding to grant consent does not mean it's always granted. She can choose not to give consent or withdraw consent at any moment for any reason and if the man refuses to obey he is raping her.

You're being incredibly disingenuous with this argument.

> So even if we were to believe such prostitutes exist, since you cannot prove that a prostitute really wants to have sex with the old man as the difference between A and B all resides in her head, **we cannot simply take her word for it**

This is a problem that only you are having and I'm not going to hold your hand through it simply because you refuse to trust women or think them capable of the cognitive ability required with giving consent. If we cannot simply take a woman's word for it when she grants consent than women are untrustworthy creatures incapable of deciphering their own wants and motivations, so how can we trust her word when she doesn't grant consent anymore? Clearly the solution is to just ignore a woman's consent all together. This is what you're arguing in favor for. How about we just trust women with our own bodies and decisions and allow us to consent with or revoke consent from whoever we so choose for whatever reason we deem fit? This is the same respect we give men.

> I clearly hate women and my ""fixation"" on them has nothing to do with the discussion of the closing of the 1st feminist sub,

If you're referring to gender critical I don't consider any sub that stands to demonize and target one of the most vulnerable groups of women today as feminist, but clearly our opinion on what is feminist differs very much since yours is dependent upon taking away women's rights and mine is dependent upon empowering women to be and do what they want without pressure from any external systems.

The fact that you screenshot a picture of me arguing in favor of women's consent as the catalyst for this outrage is illustrative of your entire problem - women's right to choose and govern our own bodies.

If I want to have sex with someone I will. If I don't I won't. That's it. I'm sorry you're so upset by my bodily autonomy but I'll leave that to you to figure out on your own since this conversation is far beyond the point of being productive and it's not worth discussing it with you further."

Then you're extremely fucking dense, to be honest.

I'm not usually a big proponent of the whole ""only WE can say certain things"" mindset among liberal idpol type people, but slurs are probably the one and only topic in which I agree with them. ""Uncle Tom"" is a word used by black people to disparage other black people - YOU as a white man have absolutely zero business calling a woman ""the uncle tom of women"".

1597687198.0|announcements|sinekonata|"So to you the money is what guarantees that you want to make it. And the more they pay, the more you feel it's appreciated and the more you want to make the ""gift"".

Meaning there's no way of differentiating your situation (A.) from that of a person who just hates making the object but makes it for the money (B.). That's very clever and convenient. I guess the equivalent of your paid rape apologist argument for unpaid rape apologists would be :   
""Some women really like to be raped, meaning that although she is consenting and therefore is not really a rape, everything else is exactly the same : the guy wants to rape her, she struggles, he does it anyway, he thinks he raped her, but she actually loved it. It's her kink, she thinks that since he risked prison to rape her, he really must have wanted her, which is exactly what she wants and her wants are very valid"".

Out of precaution, to avoid raping women, we don't start by assuming that there might be a chance that she loves it but still needs to be coerced into it, or that coercion is exactly what makes them feel appreciated.

So even if we were to believe such prostitutes exist, since you cannot prove that a prostitute really wants to have sex with the old man as the difference between A and B all resides in her head, we cannot simply take her word for it and might as well suppose, out of caution to prevent rape, that, as most of them say, they do it because they need the sustenance and wouldn't let the old guy rape them otherwise.

You're the one who needs to rethink its liberal individualistic cowardly views. I was never talking of individuals and their ""valid experiences"", I'm talking systemically. So yes, in a world without oppression/coercion, we would not be having this discussion, I don't care what women do with their bodies as long as they're not coerced into it, which today they clearly are, and you're still defending their rapists, you horrible cowardly traitor.

\> your hyper fixation on *women* and *our* financial exchanges makes me doubtful of the sincerity of your argument here  
Sure, I'm actually a misogynist, I clearly hate women and my ""fixation"" on them has nothing to do with the discussion of the closing of the 1st feminist sub, only with controlling women like a good patriarch. STFU, enough of your rape apologist women traitor pimping.

This is how this discussion started, with [rape apology](https://imgur.com/r6ZoSwU) and your apology of rape hasn't budged a notch so I'll be resorting to shorter, mostly ad-hominem  messages from now on."

You do realise preventing ""hate speech"" means no longer supporting free speech, right? You can do one or the other (hopefully free speech), but not both, and ""prevention"" in this context is really nothing but censorship.

Further, there's no definition of what ""hate speech"" is - it's a loose blanket term, and the words and phrases it covers can easily expand over time since not everyone is ""offended"" by the same things. Therefore, choosing to ban ""hate speech"" just isn't a viable option, since people will be blindsided and punished for something they and many others would consider harmless but the loud minority consider ""offensive""."

The Senior Editor

We have multiple confirmations that a vaccine for COVID 19 not only exists but has existed for some time, since 2019, perhaps as early as 2017.

John Hankey reports that Trump and his inner circle were vaccinated in November 2019, only days after the virus was deployed.

Months ago, VT traced the creation of the current versions of COVID 19/SARS COV 2 to a USAID-CIA funded and peer reviewed study done by the University of North Carolina by scientists closely aligned with America’s defense community.

We are also told that COVID 19, as VT reported in March, was deployed against China, then Italy, then France, then Iran and Spain and then the US as a “fund raiser.”

COVID 19 is the ultimate “sanction” and ultimate tool to bring about that “New World Order” we have been hearing about.  Now we see it as a reality.

This article contains hard proof that cannot be questioned or denied, which you may submit to any government agency or healthcare professional.

What is not yet proven but coming into focus is that the US biological weapons program at Fort Detrick, Maryland, equipment and certainly key staff, certainly migrated to secret labs at large state universities in order to “hide in plain sight.”

1597181119.0|announcements|Torboy007|This was exactly what I thought- And how do we know that Reddit isn't in bed with the DNC in terms of Donations? I think Reddit should have to publicly disclose it's finances, including IRS tax returns, as well as the IRS Tax Returns of all of it's employees,  in order to be allowed to have ads of any kind on its platform AT ALL.
1597179770.0|announcements|Torboy007|The problem i see with this is that this kind of policy is election tampering in and of itself, especially if Reddit, Inc. ever made a single political campaign contribution to a member of either political party.- which would mean that Reddit then must effectively recuse itself of administering political ads at all (instead leaving it to disinterested third parties that haven't made campaign contributions of any kind to either party)  because such would be a conflict of interest.
1597178425.0|announcements|Torboy007|"The problem I see with this is that there needs to be made a clear distinction in the rule that makes the distinction between something that attacks someone's values, and something that promotes hate. For example- The fact that someone doesn't accept homosexuality does not make them ""anti-gay"" in the slightest.  Otherwise, we're headed for the same ruins that Facebook is becoming, with moderation getting more tied up in fee-fees versus demonstrating actual clear-cut rule violations. 

It also needs to be made clear that the rules are a two-way street and there needs to be consistent, swift, and extremely severe enforcement against the moderators on some of the more liberal subs that are consistently violating the moderator guidelines."

tldr: helped codify RSS, assisted in Markdown's development, web.py's development, helped organize Creative Commons, and was one of the first real and effective online activists, assisting groups like Fight For the Future to fight bills that restrict and hurt the Internet and raise awareness through quality web design and informative videos.

He was caught downloading JSTOR articles and they gathered some charges on him. He hanged himself -- allegedly -- before it could go to trial.

The Internet and the world lost a bright soul, for setting free information that every American paid for through their taxes or through inflated prices at market.

1596681330.0|announcements|HTPDon1947|"Hidden Treasure Productions began in January of this year with the same high hopes that many other endeavors had. Don’t get me wrong! We still have high hopes and are going forward with the great desire to be successful! However, the onset of Coronavirus has caused us to be creative. Fortunately for us, our company is made up of “creative types!” 

Early on, the decision was made to hold all auditions and rehearsals online through Zoom Technology. That has worked out surprisingly well. We had also planned to start meeting as a live cast in early August. The Jury is still out on that one, but we are hopeful that we will soon be able to rehearse outside in someone’s back yard in groups of less than 10. Living in a nice climate allows us to do that, even in the autumn months.  

We currently have a perfect venue booked for October 9-11, 2020. However, if we must change the dates to early November, due to CDC gatherings restrictions, then that is what we’ll do. We must all be adaptive in this new world we are living in today! Our Director, Valerie Herrera, has put together a stellar cast. Many of the performers are professional actors and have extensive resumes. 

Make plans to come out to see “Shadows of the Mind” in downtown Oceanside, California. The definite dates will be forthcoming and will be posted on the Hidden Treasure Productions website.  [https://hiddentreasureproductions.org](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/5464046714808358737/6752820149591034478#)

Our ultimate goal is to take our production internationally in the Spring of 2021, either to the U.K. or to Ukraine. Plans are still underway to accomplish this. All of this to say, “Ain’t no COVID gonna’ keep us down!”

Written by Beverly Dennison,

HTP Director of Communication"

No, I ignored the irrelevant wrong thing that wasn't important, and fixed your incorrect statement to make actual sense. This is not 'cherry picking' anything; I'm correcting your incorrect statements, because you really don't comprehend what you're talking about, and you're conflating discrete concepts, and you don't even know that you're using the wrong ""logical argument terminology"" words. 

> giving more of your contact info to a site is more of a privacy risk. This is not complicated arithmetic.

Then what's *my* email? 

The email doesn't exist in a vacuum, ***but it's not fucking relevant because Reddit does nothing at all with that email beyond verification of the account holder.*** They do not contact you with it, and nothing on Reddit can connect to it to use it for identification in any way. My verified username doesn't personally identify me in any manner beyond to that username; my spam mail isn't showing up on Reddit feeds, and my Reddit comments don't affect my spam mail. They are insulated by a metaphorical vacuum because there's no connection between them. And guess what? Using the email address to send confirmation of the username *still doesn't add any connection between those two things.* Neither does using my device's camera to pull an algorithm from a QR code which has been associated to my username.

Factually, it *protects* your privacy, because it gives you a method to verify your credentials (which, if you recall, are made up by you yourself in the first place, because you choose your own username and password) without having to use your email address. If it sent you an email every time to make sure it was still you, then anyone looking over your shoulder while you do it can get your username, can't they?"

You mean, ""In other words, your anonymous email is literally and exactly that, and two-factor authentication using it is not personally identifiable."" Which was my exact and explicit point. The fact that your typing style is traceable through anything that you write is not relevant to that fact. The fact that your IP can be used to track your shopping habits is also not relevant to that fact. The fact that the email address can be on a list somewhere is not relevant, because it isn't visibly attached to your Reddit username unless you make a post about how your username uses that email address.

1596539930.0|announcements|Garlic-dough-balls|"How can you see the full image in the mobile app? 

For example looking at this post on the website Vs on the android app 

Within the website I see the full image top to bottom and left to right. 

On the current official android app the image is cropped to a square aspect ratio cutting off part of the bottom of the image and some off the sides. 

While for this image on this post it's not a huge problem, subs with images including text screenshots for example up to half the image is missing. Makes reading text based image posts very difficult. You loose detail on portrait images where parts are cut off. 


Thanks.

Osteen doesn't get any money from ""Night of Hope,"" dumbass. The church gets money. It's tax exempt. If Osteen gets any, it's personal income and he must pay taxes.

That's what fucktards always say when they get their panties tooken down for some spanky spanky with facts. It's not a ""known narrative"" documented on your little social media account. It's a fake narrative and I proved that. I humiliated you with facts. You can't refute any of them. ""BUT I SAW A MEME ON THE FACEBOOK!"" is all you have.

Socialism requires moral guidance to be regulated in and enforced. It stifles innovation bc no one has the motivation to create bc incentive is lacking.

Being compensated for a skill set is moral. The more specialized and in demand your skills the more value you can demand.

There's a reason socialism has never succeeded. Not only has it failed repeatedly, Venezuela being there best illustration of it's failure, it's had catastrophic consequences."

I feel like a warm or hot shower doesn’t really wake me up, but I’m conditioned to feel that way because it’s the first thing I do when I get out of bed in the morning. It’s not the shower, but the act of actually getting up and starting my day that wakes me up. If I got up everyday and spent 15 minutes washing dishes I would feel like washing dishes wakes me up.      
Cold, warm, or hot, a shower has never made me feel like going to sleep. I’m standing up the whole time, have to spend time afterwards drying off, and I never end up at the right temperature to sleep at."

We hit it off, but nothing ended up happening between us. Mostly, because my friend was an idiot, that wouldn't give us any room. Made me realize what a piece of shit he is and I stopped talking to him. What the hell was I going on about? Drinking. Don't go that route. Find a way to meet potential partners. Try to get your friends and family to set you up on dates, maybe. I've been set up with some women I liked. Just too shy to actually talk, unless I drink and I don't meet women that like to drink very often (I don't blame them). Seems like you've had enough of being single and for people like us it doesn't just magically get better, especially when times are tough (losing a loved one or a close friend).

  Rambling. Anyway, you have to keep looking. If you give up, it's not going to happen. I have no idea how people meet anymore, though. I'm sure a younger person will have some suggestions."

I was thinking more about those ""light"" examples. Bcs day in day out I see a lot of ppl who are trying to ""blame"" on depresion and anxiety over their laziness and incompetence to give a little bit of effort in their life. 
!! People who are ill are ill and thats not something to question !!
I've been through 2-3 mayor depresion periods in my life, but last suicide toughts was when i was 12-15 yrs old, and that was before any of those periods. After last depresion period ( around 3-5 yrs ago ) I told my self that I dont want to live like that never again, and I'm trying every day to change harmfull toughts and to change POV in my head to make it more friendly and positive enviroment. Sounds easy but its not. 
My best friend had some suicide toughts and he needed professional help bcs he was unable to handle it alone. Thank god he is fine right now.
Also I'm happy about you, and that you are still here so we can exchange some words :) 
I understand that there are some things which you cannot change that are playing big part in our brain games. Thats why I was talking about those things which you can change and make your life easier. 
Hope that I've maded it more clear what I had in mind, I know life its not easy, and everyone has their own daily struggles which we know nothing about. And even a professional help is not helpfull if you dont let it help you."

1601852423.0|AskReddit|MyShixteenthAccount|"I don't really know what ""tear a whole in the continuum"" means but given current known physics there are a few straightforward ways of time travel.

All of them appear *impractical* and many physicists think they, for various reasons, are actually impossible.  But this is an unknown at the moment.

Wormholes are pretty simple. 

1) make a wormhole 

2) drag one end around near the speed of light 

3) The ends of the wormhole are now at different times

Now, it looks like there's not way to do this without the whole thing collapsing catastrophically, (especially if it's larger than particle sized), but we don't *know* that it wouldn't work.

There is no ""be the fulcrum.""  You just can't do that.

""Dimension hopping"" could actually be a thing in two senses.  First, under certain descriptions, there are paths into and then out of black holes but they're one way trips into what might be ""other dimensions.""  There isn't anything that could survive the journey...even in principle.  But maybe we discover some new physics that allows for some sort of shielding?

The more run of the mill (fits with currently understood physics) method would be to just go to sleep for an indefinite amount of time and wait for the universe to repeat.  If you assume the universe is infinite in time then, eventually there will be spontaneous big bang like events producing ""new universes.""  This would require you to go into some sort of stasis (computer upload?) for unfathomable amounts of time.  But then, you just wait until things are how you want them and then wake up.

If it's actually possible to time travel it's probably more like ""turning to the right"" in the sense of - you just need to go the other direction in time (which, really, is what the wormhole is).  It's not exciting - you just go a direction which just happens to be backwards in time.  Likely this would require exceedingly unusual circumstances and huge amounts of energy since it doesn't appear to happen naturally with any frequency.

So, basically, current known physics does not preclude time travel.  Not at all really aside from *possibly* requiring extremely large amounts of energy.

Though, again, I think time travel is precluding prior to physics but that's another discussion."

The US hardly leads the world in connection speeds, but there are plenty of decidedly first world countries that are worse off.

However, Australia does beat the US in terms of mobile speeds, we get about 75% of what they do. Looks to me like mobile data is where we fall behind quite a bit of the first world, though the margins are at least a bit better."

1601852488.0|aww|CaptainNoBoat|"Right, they weren't selectively bred, but they are still being intentionally bred to sell, and their numbers are increasing rapidly.

Partly because of websites like this, where millions of people see them, think ""stubby legs are cute,"" despite the health effects and lack of functionality, and the demand increases.

If that's what people want, so be it. I'll just never understand it myself. 

It's like if a dog breed had a genetic mutation to have tiny feet that made it harder to walk, run, jump, etc, and led to osteoarthritis, but everyone found it ""cute,"" so they began to be intentionally bred. It's just a weird thing to perpetuate."

1601852016.0|aww|hedonismbot89|The gene that results in the munchkin traits is a dominant gene, not a recessive gene. It’s a heterozygous gene (meaning 1 gene is dominant & 1 is recessive) because embryos with 2 copies of the munchkin gene aren’t viable. That’s why when two munchkins are bred together they have smaller than normal litter sizes. They literally cannot be inbred to select for the munchkin characteristics. I agree that it’s not something we should encourage overall. I’m sure that there are some health issues like back problems, but it wasn’t a trait humans specifically bred the cats over multiple generations to achieve like a pug or a bulldog. The first **confirmed** cat that gave birth to a munchkin kitten was found underneath a truck in Louisiana in the 1970’s. Humans had nothing to do with this trait showing up.

1601851215.0|aww|hedonismbot89|The gene that results in the munchkin traits is a dominant gene, not a recessive gene. It’s a heterozygous gene (meaning 1 gene is dominant & 1 is recessive) because embryos with 2 copies of the munchkin gene aren’t viable. That’s why when two munchkins are bred together they have smaller than normal litter sizes. They literally cannot be inbred to select for the munchkin characteristics. I agree that it’s not something we should encourage overall. I’m sure that there are some health issues like back problems, but it wasn’t a trait humans specifically bred the cats over multiple generations to achieve like a pug or a bulldog. The first **confirmed** cat that gave birth to a munchkin kitten was found underneath a truck in Louisiana in the 1970’s. Humans had nothing to do with this trait showing up.

1601851131.0|aww|Dawnyz|"Congrats. Wishing you a life time of happiness. Just a tiny bit of advice. There will be detours in your happy journey, don't let them get you down, no matter what it is. If you live that person as much as you do on your wedding day you can't get past ANYTHING,  you simply have to work for it. So cherish all the blissfully happy times and be willing to work through the hardest times, times that could shatter your heart. Those times are what will bring you closer foregiveness is vitally important in a marriage. So the saying love deeply, cherish each other and forgive quickly. Believe after 32 years of keeping a marriage string and loving  we've had to learn this. The forgiving quickly is the most important part of the saying. 
Wishing you a long and happy marriage, truly I am. <3 <3 :)"

1601850990.0|aww|hedonismbot89|The gene that results in the munchkin traits is a dominant gene, not a recessive gene. It’s a heterozygous gene because embryos with 2 copies of the munchkin gene aren’t viable. That’s why when two munchkins are bred together they have smaller than normal litter size. They literally cannot be inbred to select for the munchkin characteristics. I agree that it’s not something we should encourage overall. I’m sure that there are some health issues like back problems, but it wasn’t a trait humans specifically bred the cats over multiple generations to achieve like a pug or a bulldog. The first **confirmed** cat that gave birth to a munchkin kitten was found underneath a truck in Louisiana in the 1970’s. Humans had nothing to do with this trait showing up.

Can't let a puppy run around the house unsupervised unless you have literally no possessions you don't want being chewed to pieces. Crate training is when you get them used to the cage. They naturally like small little cubby holes, you just have to convince them to want that one.

 Once they are older there is little to no need for the cage. A lot of dog owners keep the cage though as a bedroom for the dog. Once they're used to it it's not a cage, it's a private safe spot. Like a bedroom."

Some wild animals can be ""Okay"" as pets with a LOT of attention, but event the most well behaved will start to act out, sometimes dangerously, if they aren't getting adequate attention and stimulation.

Also illegal pet trades are horrible for wild populations. For a lot of ""exotic pets"" the pet trade is one of the leading causes of them being endangered.

Keeping wild animals as pets isn't healthy for them and is one of the pinnacles of human entitlement."

1601850421.0|aww|mom0nga|"In cats, [purring and roaring are mutually exclusive](https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/why-can-only-big-cats-roar/) because both noises have to do with the shape of the cat's voicebox. So if a cat can roar, it can't purr, and vice-versa. The ""true"" big cats, in the genus *Panthera* (lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars) roar but can't purr. Mountain lions and cheetahs can purr, but not roar, because they aren't in this group. Genetically, mountain lions are more closely related to housecats than they are to big cats."

Only two of us were awake enough by then and we both had look at each other to confirm we’d heard it."

Squirrels really are cute though.


My highschool best friend's family fostered one for a while, they're not sure where it came from but was found half frozen on the front porch. It would climb all over your body in a frenzy like you were a tree. Was a loud little thing but her mom thought the squirrel read at least 3 years old. Once it was healthy enough, and the weather was warm again; they let it go outside. It stuck around and they fed it outside but it wouldn't let them touch it anymore once it was outside again. Her mom still leaves food out for it and now the family of squirrels around. They're still loud little things though lol.

one time her dad stomped over and waved his fist yelling at one that was being a bit extra ridiculous when he was trying to explain something to us and it peed all over him. It's still funny. Shut him up fast. He was a good sport about it and laughed too."

1601849998.0|aww|invisiblegiants|"For some people it could be a great benefit, but it’s not the perfect solution and for some it can be a mistake. With all due respect have you suffered from severe clinical depression? There are times clinically depressed people will struggle to walk or even generally care for a dog. That will leave them feeling like a failure and the dog will suffer for it. People considering a dog need to be realistic about what they can manage. A dog is a living being with its own needs, not a cure or a crutch. It’s honestly doing people and dogs a disservice not to stress this. 

Anyone wanting a dog needs to take the time to figure out how much time and effort they can put into it. Don’t just get _____ breed because it’s beautiful and you are lonely. Know breed characteristics, learn about exercise requirements, and if you get a rescue (and you should) really know what you might be getting into with emotionally rehabilitating an animal that might be traumatized. Don’t jump in blind and set yourself up for failure because all of our media makes dogs seem like these magical creatures that will bring you nothing but joy and friendship."

She will jump on my back and shoulders whenever I’m not giving her enough attention and likes to sleep under the covers in my bed. My other cat that I’ve had since she was a kitten doesn’t bother with either ... 


(Apparently sleeping next to you is a way that cats help to protect themselves. In the wild start cats will often sleep together even though they are not pack animals and will distance themselves from each other during the day. They sleep together as they know it’s safer and are keeping themselves and others safe. My kitty thinks she’s keeping me safe while the younger one hunts the spiders round the house and leaves them for me in the morning)"

Then yesterday she seemed a bit nauseous so the vet gave us anti nauseous tablets. Thought she would be fine until Monday when we can take her back to the vet. We went away 2.5 hour drive to try enjoy the first holiday we had in 2 years and got a call from our house sitter early that morning saying she had passed away.

Also, she's still too young for chipping yet.  She is probably JUST weaned.  Also, we were home when she flew through our cat door which is too high off the ground for her to have handled under her own steam.  After she came flying in. Immediately went to check the porch in case there were siblings out there as well.  No siblings, but there was a clean brown blanket that doesn't belong to us laying there.  I'm guessing she in it until just before they pitched her in our cat door.

BBC to produce it's programming without advertisements, allowing it to (theoretically) stay free of corporate or private interests influencing it. (allow for example the BBC news to do exposes on companies they may go soft on if they were a major advitiser for example) It also allows BBC programing to have no Ad breaks, which is nice.

Store frozen are a little better for this if you're in a pinch because they can flash freeze their produce, which does less damage.  Personally, though, for something like pico or guac, where the raw ingredients are the star of the show, I'd always chop fresh."

1601850728.0|funny|dthlee|"Yeah. The four wisdom teeth extraction was about 2k, including local anesthesia and a CBCT. The dentist said gas would cost more. Didn't do the gas because it seemed unnecessary, which it was. The root canal and crown was similar in price, but marginally less expensive, IIRC. Might've been the other way around, though. The root canal and crown was around 2k together.

I also saved some money because I had my root canal done in the same visit and the local anesthetic ""overlapped"", in that it was already numb from one procedure, so the dentist was able to use less anesthetic overall than if I had them done in separate visits.

Either way, whether it's gas or local anesthesia, that cost definitely has to be grouped together with the cost of the actual extraction. Dunno about you, but I would never get wisdom teeth extracted without either local anesthesia or gas."

1601850543.0|funny|Meric_|"A.

Equation for bell peppers   f(x) = 20x + 100

Apples = f(x) = x^2 + 10   (Assuming they double the amount they buy per day)

Set the two equations equal to each other.

20x+100 = x^2 +10

x^2 -90=20x

x^2 -20x-90 = 0 

Quadratic Equation and solve. Throw out the negative answer, and get ~23.78. 


A. It will take 24 days for there to be more apples than bell peppers



B. IF the volume of the room is 42.47 cubic meters, that is 42470000 cubic centimeters.

By day 23 (one day before apples outpace peppers) we have 539 apples, and 560 bell peppers.

539 * 180 + 560 * 240 = 231420


B. No, the Apples and bell peppers will not be able to fill the room before the apples out pace



Edit: I just realized that I did the Apple Equation wrong when I relooked at it since I didn't add back the amount of apples they previously had.

Can't be bothered to fix this though, maybe someone else can"

If you feel strongly about it, and found someone of a different race that you fell in love with and decide to marry, only for your grandparents/family to berate and verbally abuse them, then you might think it best to just distance from that person. 

I’d wager you don’t feel very strongly about racism, which would explain your views on this topic and why someone would have to be “out of their mind,” or have a mental disorder to distance from someone who genuinely hates and spews hateful things about your husband/wife. Which is ridiculous just so you know. 

You’re right about me being lucky enough to not have grandparents with those views. But even if you do, and still keep in contact with them regardless of them hurting others you love, it doesn’t make you right.

All the signage and marketing materials were up for grabs once they were no longer needed, so I got tons of movie posters, even the big 4 panel vinyl window clings.

1601848228.0|funny|RhFpZESmn8Sefni3q3Jb|"I am neither a doctor nor dentist, and you shouldn't rely on this advice.  However:

I have Invisalign as part of a process for implants for congenitally missing teeth in a difficult situation.  As I couldn't have other pontics in place while my teeth were being moved to fit the implants, I had false teeth sitting in the aligners.  It would have been *very* noticeable if I removed them around others, and my bite was different enough without them that eating could be difficult and potentially dangerous for my other teeth (it would have been easy to chip my front teeth).  

As a result, my orthodontist suggested that I try wearing the aligners at essentially all times, including when I ate and drank.  This experiment actually worked pretty well.  The aligners would degrade pretty quickly, but we switched them out every week, and as I wore them for all but a few minutes of every day (when I brushed them, and my teeth), the movement still worked well.  There was some limitation on foods that would be too abrasive, but most foods I ate regularly were alright, despite the definite decrease in tooth sharpness.  I also didn't drink anything *too* hot, but tea and coffee at what I would consider proper temperatures for appreciating them were fine.  There was some staining, but it was manageable.  This was despite my drinking quite a bit of red wine.

The caveats here are that my teeth have otherwise always been excellent, I've never had problems with tooth decay, my diet likely has considerably lower sugar than most people have, I've always had to be careful with foods and dental/orthodontic complexities (the aligners were far less fragile than some non-removable arrangements I had had), and between my dentist, oral surgeon, and orthodontist, my teeth were being looked at quite frequently.  

Now that I have temporary pontics on implants, and I can reasonably eat without the aligners, I do take them out, but I went through two years of wearing them and eating, with no problems.

So in short, despite the recommendations, needing to remove the aligners to eat and drink is a major problem, it may be possible to discuss wearing them at all times with your orthodontist."

All the staff has PPE at all times. All patients wear masks, except when you are actually getting worked on. They are only using every other room, so there is a lot of space in the office.

After you ask for ID they reach down for thier waist very fast, the cop has less than a second to decide if the person is a threat. Why would someone reach for anything that fast when your supposed to just keep your hands on the steering wheel. It has happend where a cop pulls someone over and they get shot as soon as they get to the window, or someone draws a gun and tries to shoot them. That's why it's a horrible idea, in a situation like that the brain has a fight or flight response, and in most cases it's a fight response. It's not right but it's not an unreasonable response all things considered.

He walked to the lab trolley that was already there and took a vial of a clear liquid and poured it into a vessel that was sitting in an ice bath.

He took a second vial of a clear liquid and added it the the first and gave it a stir with a glass rod.

He took a third vial of a clear liquid - this one had some viscosity - and he added it tot he ice bath and very carefully stirred it.

He then took a pipette and removed the brown liquid that had formed and put it into a reaction tube.

Took the reaction tube to the nearest sink and dropped it - big bag, tube shattered smoke and....... he said his first words in 5 minutes

Pretty sure it's available on all consoles now.

It's a fantastic game, you can either play for domination take over the world victory with combat units like I did, or you can go for science victory by being the first person to launch a rocket to another planet, or diplomatic victory by being friends with the whole world until you are elected world leader, or culture victory by having your tourism and works of art and culture influence the world, or religious victory by having your religion take over the world."

Look at any star wars opening day.  They were dressing up for the latest star wars films, but dressed as say, Darth Vader.

1601852426.0|gaming|Doctor-Amazing|"This is so weird to me because I've never heard of anyone doing it with an n64. The top loading cartridges just worked. No blowing required.

The whole thing came about because the NES had this odd mechanism where you slid the cartridge in then pushed it down. Over time the springs wore out and the game didn't make proper contact with the console. This meant that you often had to make sure you had the game in the exact right position to work and you'd end up spending a few minutes nudging it side to side or popping it in out a few times. Blowing on the game was another solution though people debate its effectiveness."

When you have someone, npc or human to pull aggro it really would probably slow the learning curve of the game overall because you’re not feeling the pressure to really learn the attacks. And if you summon a human 9/10 times they’re going to zerg the fuck out of the boss and kill it in 1/3rd the time

Once you kill YuYevon, he dies, sin dies, Auron (a father figure to you) reveals he was dead all along and no longer needs to watch over you. 

Then.... you start to vanish right infront of Yuna, the girl you love. You knew it was coming but you hid it from her. She refuses to ""send"" you, you explain you have to go. You go to jump into heaven, she calls out your man and runs towards you. As she goes to embrace you, she runs through you and falls to the ground. You are fading away.

1601851502.0|gaming|deathinactthree|"> as I understand the writers had a grand finale planned for the series with some cosmic horror, Lovecraft vibes around how you’re meant to save humanity. Dead Space 3 explored a touch of that with the introduction of the Brethren Moons, but DS4 was supposedly going to explore it, and the intense psychological trauma they cause, more directly and as a component of gameplay.

Yep, 4 was supposed to be about the Brethren Moons, where they came from, and how there's something even worse out there that spawned/created them.  As you said, Lovecraftian-style ""psychological trauma"" was going to be a significant gameplay component.  Unfortunately between the bunch of infighting at EA during the game's creation causing DS3 to go so insanely over budget to the point that it never could have made enough money to be considered profitable, 4 was just starting the storyboard phase IIRC when it got canned.

That said, I did genuinely enjoy the game.  Yes it was more action than horror, but it played really well IMO and had some great moments."

And it's weird because a lot of those people are into tech. If SMB3 doesn't boot they'll take it out and blow on it and re-insert it, but if their graphics card is glitched the idea of ""blowing on it"" is ridiculous, even though it's literally the same type of thing."

The gyro controls in Dream Team fucked me over though. For some reason my New 3DS XL just does not work with the gyro. Idk if I damaged it at some point or what."

343 should have focused on other things the way Reach and ODST did, so I think that's where the storytelling fell apart. Mechanically they're pretty good games (although 5 was a little jinkie) 

I'd say bungies real issue was how rough the first Destiny was at launch and how little storytelling it contained, early days of Destiny 2 weren't much different. Bungie is good at follow up though and both games became great. Bungie's reputation suffers a little bit because people make up their minds about something and rarely give things another chance, they really need to stop shipping unfinished or unpolished things imo"

It does suck that they went through with the boat deal when you said you would just buy another pc and are now going back on the deal. They almost certainly didn't think you'd be able to get another pc so fast. Anyway, it does sound like you spend a lot of time gaming. You say about 9 hours a day, mixed in with homework. Is it obvious to them what part of that time is homework vs what part is gaming? It might just look like all gaming to them. Perhaps it would help to make your time doing homework more obvious. Also they might be concerned about your gaming cutting into your sleep, as based on your schedule you're getting a max of 6 hours a night, which is not enough. If you want to stay at home, perhaps you could have a discussion with them about setting some time limits on your gaming rather than getting rid of the pc all together. I do see the attraction of the freedom of leaving home, but the responsibilities that come with that would definitely cut into your gaming time.

Halo 1's multiplayer is unplayable if you choose to use any weapon that isn't a Magnum, Halo 2's multiplayer seriously lacks impact and is painfully slow, and Halo 3's multiplayer is even slower.

Halo 4 and 5's multiplayers are fluid. You have more movement options than moving from side to side and being caught from behind or above doesn't instantly mean you lose because your opponent landed the first shot.

Destiny was made under Activision, so I don't blame Bungie for the issues with Destiny. I am intrigued to see where the game goes, because the core gameplay is solid and Bungie makes a good shooter.

I think both 343 and Bungie are studios that have made some mistakes for sure, but they make solid games overall. I don't think they've tainted Halo's name or ruined Bungie's legacy."

1601850702.0|gaming|kindastandtheman|">You think that the issue of children gambling isn't worthy of mention? Yeah no, this is a major issue that you can't just gloss over, and one the article you linked covered. Loot boxes are gambling, and in most countries children are not allowed to legally gamble. Games either need strong age gates, or they need to drop loot boxes entirely for all countries that prohibit children from gambling.

You're twisting my words, you know damn well that's not what I meant when I typed that out. I can't tell if you're just being intentionally obtuse to what I'm trying to say, or if I was actually on the mark with the delusional old man thing. The point I was making was that children shouldn't even have access to credit cards or digital wallets in the first place. The responsibility should lie with the parent to properly supervise their children. 

The game explicitly states in it's terms of service that any player should be of the age of majority in their country, and that any adult or guardian of the player should be held fully liable for not supervising their children.

>You don't see the problem with children gambling? Are you going to support dropping any current age restrictions concerning gambling, I take it? The laws need to be treated equally in these matters, so long as a 10 year old can't legally bet money on blackjack then the same kid shouldn't be allowed to buy a loot box.

Again, you're cherry picking out my points and not addressing the rest of what I said there. What part of ""these are all optional purchases that you don't need to play or enjoy the game"" doesn't sink it's way into your thick skull? If the content was only available through purchase the. I'd be against it entirely, but it isn't. Everything in that game is unlockable by playing, but if someone wants to speed up their progression by spending $5 on some magic tomes then who cares?

>All the measures you've mentioned are about as effective as the ""Are you 18 or older"". And that's on the company to provide an age gate that actually works, if they can't provide then obviously they need to drop the loot boxes altogether.

Fun fact: part of the problem was us blowing into it.  The moisture in our breath is hell on those old connectors and by blowing into them you'd help oxidize the connectors while clearing debris.  Then, once oxidized, sometimes it would require moisture to actually make connection."

Thought it was cool that direct gameplay influenced the story vs. say choosing different dialogue options regardless of how you got there. I think it also maniacal glee of someone who doesn’t give effs when doing the bad ending play through and just letting loose. Its fun to use all your tools, kill everyone in your path, and makes sense why the world you end up in is shittier. But to each their own. Thanks for explaining.

If you can agree that ad hominems make the argument less effective, that's great.  Though you are still relying on them I notice.

> Well, given that most children don't have credit cards and have to ask their parents for permission to make these sorts of purchases, and that parents are able to view and approve what charges are sent towards their account so figured it wouldn't even be worthy of mention.

You think that the issue of children gambling isn't worthy of mention?  Yeah no, this is a major issue that you can't just gloss over, and one the article you linked covered.  Loot boxes are gambling, and in most countries children are not allowed to legally gamble. Games either need strong age gates, or they need to drop loot boxes entirely for all countries that prohibit children from gambling.

> I think we're just going to have to agree to disagree on this matter, because I don't see the issue with them in this context at all.

You don't see the problem with children gambling?  Are you going to support dropping any current age restrictions concerning gambling, I take it?  The laws need to be treated equally in these matters, so long as a 10 year old can't legally bet money on blackjack then the same kid shouldn't be allowed to buy a loot box.

And so long as games like Genshin Impact allow minors to buy loot boxes, they'll face pressure from international gambling laws.  Companies like EA and Epic have already dropped loot boxes in some games in order to comply, usually adopting the battle pass  model instead.  And as long as people keep complaining and putting on the pressure, loot boxes are going to become less and less common.

> Would like them to put in one of those, ""Are you 18 or older?"" verifications that always seem to work so well?

All the measures you've mentioned are about as effective as the ""Are you 18 or older"".  And that's on the company to provide an age gate that actually works, if they can't provide then obviously they need to drop the loot boxes altogether.  Fortnite, Battlefront 2, Destiny, they all ended up dropping loot boxes largely because all of their respective companies realized that child gambling was an issue that would give them grief.

> But hey, at least you're still acting like a stuck up out of touch old man, so points for consistency.

And you're still using ad hominems to support shitty loot boxes.  Is this really the hill you want to die on, saying it's only old people that hate loot boxes?"

He found them again years later and upon this rediscovery, he has gained new insights that allow him to appreciate the album on a deeper level than he previously could. Just like some similar music in the Post/Prog-rock world, it took him some time to truly appreciate the album. He attempts to elaborate more but he knows that what he gets out of it isn't going to be the same as another listener. He enjoyed the ups and downs, through the oppressive melancholy and to the minuscule glimmer of hope hidden within. The album clearly means a lot to OP and he felt the need to share his emotions relating to it. Not too sure what wasn't clear in what he said but I hope I managed to clear it up for you. Godspeed You! Black Emperor.

It was a critique of ""ally"" liberals who acted like they were helping the poor by talking about their problems (think Buttigieg's medicare ""for all who want it""). It was a critique of being fake woke. 

What happened with the Khmer Rouge was CIA-backed authoritarianism that was then used as propaganda to have further demonize communism and to prevent China & Vietnam from controlling all of Indochina. 

""The U.S. permitted Thailand to allow the Khmer Rouge to use bases in Thailand to wage a war of insurrection against the government in Phnom Penh that had been installed by Vietnam. Elizabeth Becker reported that U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski claimed that he ""concocted the idea of persuading Thailand to cooperate fully in efforts to rebuild the Khmer Rouge.""

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback

* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

1601846888.0|Music|re10pect|"Mechanical Bull is worth the listen, it still have 6-7 good rock songs on there, with Tonight, Temple, Wait for Me and Rock City being the best to me. 

Walls was admittedly a big letdown for me.  Reverend, Find Me, and Conversation Piece are really the only songs on there that got many repeat listens out of me. 

That being said I’m still excited to see what they release next. It’s unrealistic to expect a bands sound not to change after making it as big as they did. I hope they strip back the production a bit and just make a decent rock album."

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

There are so many good drummers out there across all the genres, that it'd be really hard to decide for me. Travis does have that super solid background of drum corps behind him, but I've always been more preferential to a drumming style that is more free-form in nature. I definitely feel that Blink did get quite a bit better with Travis coming in after Chesire and Dude Ranch, though. That's for sure.

And, tbh, I started to kind of stray away from *Strung Out* after Blackhawks, so I haven't really listened to their newer stuff all that much. But I have seen some videos of Shankle playing some of their older stuff, and he really does do a good job emulating Jordan's playing style. You can tell he's in touch with that more metal side of *Strung Out*. Which is cool.

1601844087.0|Music|HurricaneDane|"Wow! That is strikingly similar.

I was going to comment on [sampling other artists](https://youtu.be/v89CjsSOJ_c), but this seems like a different case. There's the possibility that they're using that riff with permission, although that seems unlikely. 
Could there be a crossover between musicians from both bands? I did a quick google search but didn't find much.

While it's likely that it was a blatant ripoff, it's also possible that someone heard it, liked it and forgot about it, and then pulled it out later during songwriting.  
Check out Jorge Ben Jor's [*Taj Mahal*](https://youtu.be/rfrpOhC6858) (1972).  
Sound familiar?  
Here's Rod Stewart's [*Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?](https://youtu.be/Hphwfq1wLJs) (1978).

This happens all the time in the music industry. Sometimes it's ok, sometimes people get sued. It's possible that this case has already been addressed and closed. 

It looks like Cody Fry has both [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/codyfry?lang=en) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/codyfry/?hl=en) accounts, you could try to reach out to him on one of those and see if there's more to the story."

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything.

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Anti-Flag, nofx, greenday heck even offspring all got into the political scene mostly because of Bush. Now we have a much more crazy leader and all these bands are silent. I don't get it?

1601838196.0|Music|odst94|"I think there's a common misconception that equates punk bands to anarchy just because they sing against governments. These bands are against our applications of government, not the concept of government itself.

>Why didn't anyone make a song telling them to go out and vote?

Fat Mike kick-started punkvoter.org specifically to register kids to vote in 04. This was when both of the Rock Against Bush compilations and tour raised $1 million for John Kerry. Franco un-American is specifically about how Fat Mike finally cares about politics and not nihilism or anarchism. Anarchy Camp exists, but NoFX have always had songs of fantasy: Pharmacist's Daughter, Mattersville, S&M Airlines, the Man I Killed.

Neither Anti-Flag nor Bad Religion or those other bands anarchist. They're both very progressive and their views align with Bernie Sanders, an opponent to anarchism. Robin Hood in Reverse and the Economy is Suffering... Let it Die are calls for progressivism, government assistance towards the working class and poor.

""Here's the church, there's the steeple, open up the doors corporations are people, wait what did he say? What the fuck did he say?""

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Frank Sinatra - personally I liked his acting better, still a great crooner

Henry Mancini - fantastic jazz. Peter gunn and Hatari are great soundtracks

1601836017.0|Music|Procrastinatron|"Man, everything's so fucking complicated. I can't decide whether or not I should care where my music comes from. I mean, on the one hand the comment you're talking about makes me cringe, because I am at my core a democratic socialist. Then I read the article linked below, and I see Buzzo's point (although the Nazi comment still irks me). Then I start wondering if I'm supposed to do research on every single thing that I consume. Because, I mean, on a certain level it sort of makes sense that I should, because I do want to be at least a *somewhat* ethical person. But given how complex and just outright complicated the world is now, that seems like a one-way street to becoming a pathologically fussy, neurotic mess that is so bothered by the potential consequences of my every decision that I just get stuck in a state of perpetual indecision and ethical inadequacy.

...And all I wanted was to listen to some fucking music."

> Cassandra Wilson (born 4th December 1955) is a U.S. jazz vocalist and two-time Grammy Award winner from Jackson, Mississippi. Two of her albums, Blue Skies (1988) and New Moon Daughter (1996), have topped the US jazz charts, and the latter also won her a Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Performance in 1997. More recently, Wilson's album Loverly (2008) also won the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album at the 51st Grammy Awards in 2009.

> Wilson's repertoire includes both jazz and blues standards and renditions of pop and rock songs. Her contralto voice has been described as bluesy and sultry, and the style of her music ranges from swing to funk to bossa nova. Many of the songs she covers are by artists who usually record in other genres.

> Wilson counts the late Miles Davis as one of her greatest influences. In 1989 she performed as the opening act for Davis at the JVC Jazz Festival in Chicago. In 1999 she produced Traveling Miles as a tribute to Davis. The album developed from a series of jazz concerts that she performed at Lincoln Center in November 1997 in Davis's honor and includes three selections based on Davis's own compositions, in which Wilson adapted the original themes.

We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

1601834207.0|Music|GloriousHam|"> the album hadn’t dropped yet

The Decline had been out for years for the show I was at. They had never played it live in it's entirety until the night before in Toronto. Over the years they had played bits and pieces, but never the whole song. 

Not sure why nobody knew what they were doing for 18 minutes unless nobody at that Toronto show knew who the fuck NOFX was."

1601834077.0|Music|GloriousHam|"I honestly have no idea. That sounds very familiar, but itt was like 16+ years ago and I was fucked up the entire time I was there. 

What I do remember was that my friend and I got in because some random girl and her friend literally GAVE us their tickets because they weren't going to have an issue getting in without them. We were desperate to get in and no one was selling tickets outside. Both my friend and I are still somewhat in touch with that girl to this day.

I also met Nubs. I remember that too."

1601832872.0|Music|TheCheechWizardUnit|Yes a cliche but totally awesome! That's why it's a cliche! It is a great song because it basically has all the chords you will *almost* ever need while playing the uke. If you want a beginner's too for that song only play the C, G, Am, Em and F...skip the other chords for now and maybe forever. Lol  Now go find a YouTuber that teaches it! Have fun!
1601832857.0|Music|AutoModerator|"No /r/ifyoulikeblank, /r/tipofmytongue, and request style posts. Posts asking for music recommendations based on an artist or other personal taste are not allowed. These belong in /r/ifyoulikeblank or /r/recordstore, active communities that specialize in making recommendations. Similarly, posts that ask for help identifying a song (whether it's the name of the track or a link to it) are not permitted. You may direct these kinds of posts to /r/tipofmytongue and /r/namethatsong. Generally, any request seeking a sole (or limited) identifiable answer(s) is subject to removal. These submissions fail to meet our text post standards, which focus on generating discussion.

The events industry is in crisis, so I for one am keen to get back out there as soon as I can, support people whose jobs have collapsed and enjoy live music again.

I mean these guys have been saying ""F*** the gov"" since I was 14 years old it's been 20 years making them well over 50. They still dress the same and look the same. Like seriously dudes grow up. All their music has gotten worse with time. Not one punk or ska band has done something good in the last 15 years.

You can hate the gov and I'm totally ok with that. I just think anarchy is way more dumb than democracy. Why didn't anyone make a song telling them to go out and vote? I say all this coming from the guy who had tons of bad religion, lagwagon, mellincolin, antiflag and many many more. It's all I listened to.

You can listen to what you love and I won't judge. For me I just can't get into it like i did. I just love me some phil collins, huey lewis, and hall and oates. I need music that makes me happy. If punk get you going and clicks with you... STICK WITH IT AND LOVE IT."

Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising).

Fun story: some of the guys hung out to say hello to the fans after the show. I remember passing Melvin my rolling papers for him to sign them (it was all I had on me and thought it would be cool). He grabbed them and said 'Fuck yeah I'll smoke one!' and I had to tell him (embarrassed ) I actually didn't have any pot on me. He was like 'Oh.' and signed them for me anyways.

They’re pretty right-on people in that band, and I think they were a bit horrified to be conceptually connected to the Gulf War (which I imagine they opposed)

So they changed their name to Massive, and kept it that way for years. 

I was there at the time, and that’s how I remember it, but I may be wrong.

Before that I saw them 20ish years ago and Mike was fucked up beyond redemption, beat up a kid in the crowd for spitting and one of my dumb buddies broke his neck stagediving into a crowd of preppies to teach them the dangers of going to punk shows.

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

She also makes a couple of completely discountable claims, such as Bengal contributing more economically to the Alllied war effort than the Americans

That doesn't happen; conservatives always get a break in the media, liberals are usually ignored, if possible.  Remember when the Tea Party first got started?  Usually a hand full of people would gather, with signs about how bad Obama was, some of them mis-spelled, some of them featuring racists memes with Obama's likeness altered to show him as a witch doctor or some other racist shit.  The press was besides themselves breathlessly reporting on this growing ""movement""- but when there is world wide protests about climate change or social injustice, with millions of people all over the world participating, the press is unusually quiet, with very little reporting.  Democrats in Congress can call press conferences that get ignored, while any Republican stepping up to a microphone is portrayed as a decisive leader, someone who needs to be listened to as a serious spokesperson.  Show me where I'm wrong and I will then agree with the message shared here."

NY has districts that are separated by bodies of water and aren't even geographically contiguous, and you want to cry about gerrymandering?  You're a riot, guy.

You already have your imaginary 'moderate' republicans.  They got the message they were no longer wanted after Trump was elected.  Now they're all working on *The Election Integrity Project* or *The Lincoln Project*.

1601852273.0|pics|Reacher-Said-N0thing|">  And why is that happening.

Proud Boys are a weird far-right militia in the states.  Wikipedia calls them ""far-right and neo-fascist"".  FBI has them designated as an extremist group with links to white supremacy.  Lately they've been showing up to BLM protests and attacking protesters.

During the Trump/Biden debates, the moderator asked Trump to denounce white supremacy.  Instead he randomly brought up Proud Boys (which neither the moderator nor Biden had mentioned) and famously said ""Proud boys... stand back, and stand by"".  A subtle signal that he's on their side.

People justifiably are pissed off about that and are flooding the internet with some less hateful imagery with the ""proud boys"" hashtag, involving two proud loving boys."

By claiming the phrase “Proud Boys” as part of gay pride, I feel as though they’re trying to indirectly trying to make the actual Proud Boys embarrassed by connecting it something gay. The goal is to get people thinking of gay men instead of racists, meaning the intention is to make them upset by indirectly calling them gay. As a gay man, I feel offended by this. Being gay shouldn’t be something to be disgusted by. But that’s exactly what’s going on here. It’s not an attempt to smother out their message, it’s an attempt to embarrass them because of homophobia. I hate that.

The reality is quite different than the narrative.  I fully supported Obama and voted for him twice.  After 8 years of Obama and just under 4 years of Trump it is GLARINGLY obvious who the more effective president is, and that is hands down Trump. 

Obama was a zero in a suit.  I really, really wished he was a great president.  He wasn't.  Trump, on the other hand, is running around like a maniac just getting things done one after another.  Tax reform, bringing troops home, moving the embassy in israel, signing peace deals, police reform, deporting criminals, securing the border, increasing minority wealth, increasing minority employment, appointment countless judges approved by the federalist society, and completely rearranging the global order. 

Obama couldn't have done any of those things because he just wasn't a good enough politician to accomplish them, as he fully admitted himself.  Clinton was a master politician and actually got stuff done with divided government.  Trump enjoyed a friendly Congress for two years but even after he still managed to do things people said were impossible (like moving the embassy and creating long term stability for the israelis). 

I think Obama is a nice man, a man who obviously very much loves his family and a good human being.   He was a god-awful president though, and I don't see how anyone with a brain could think otherwise."

1601851639.0|pics|nothing_911|"I wonder if he was basing it off of canadas reputation of being ruthless in the great war. 

Canadian Fred Hamilton would describe being singled out for a beating by a German colonel after he was taken prisoner. “I don’t care for the English, Scotch, French, Australians or Belgians but damn you Canadians, you take no prisoners and you kill our wounded,” the colonel told him.

While all Commonwealth units were encouraged to conduct trench raids, Canadians were widely regarded as trench raiding’s most enthusiastic practitioners and innovators.

At the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, visitors can see a case filled with the fearsome homemade weapons that Canadians trench raiders plunged into the faces and chests of their enemy: Meat cleavers, push daggers and spiked clubs.

Canadians even exploited the trust of Germans who had apparently become accustomed to fraternizing with allied units. Lieutenant Louis Keene described the practice of lobbing tins of corned beef into a neighbouring German trench. When the Canadians started hearing happy shouts of “More! Give us more!” they then let loose with an armload of grenades.

In one case, a Canadian surreptitiously slipped a live grenade into the greatcoat pockets of a German prisoner.

Probably why we started saying sorry so much."

Its like Iowa took all the tourism money they ever had and put it all into one campaign over a two year period. The campaign slogan back then was IOWA- YOU MAKE ME SMILE! 

God damn we got so into that. We actually sent off (this was back before any of us had the internet) but you could call the 1800 number and they would send you stickers and shirts and shit. If anyone ever said the world Iowa we would all look at each other and say, IOWA YOU MAKE ME SMILE! There were billboards in Kansas City, St. Joe, Columbia, St. Louis, everywhere we went there were billboards that said that. I went to school in Kirksville, MO which was less than an hour away from Iowa so one cold windy blustery Saturday we all decided to see if the billboards were true. We piled into Johnnys beat up old Chevy Cavalier and drove the 45 minutes to Iowa and made it to the State Line. It was empty and barren. A sign had spraypainted Nothing on it instead of Iowa. So the sign said Welcome to Nothing. 

We got out of the car and started screaming COME ON IOWA DO IT GODDAMNIT. Make me SMIIIIILE IOWA! YOU FUCKIN LIAR STATE MAKE ME SMILE. I don't know what we were angry about but it felt good to yell at a whole state. The advertisements were lies. We started to wonder if all advertising was lies. They promised designer jeans would make us happy and cologne and albums and clothes and Pepsi. But they were all empty promises. None of those things would make us happy. A trip. A University degree. Salaries. Engagement rings. We knew it was all bullshit. All as empty and void as Iowa itself."

All these reports have an executive summary which helps the president drill down on which information to focus on at any given time. What they don’t do is research.  That’s delegated out.

I recommend you take a tour of any presidential library and speak with a curator. They will be able to tell you that their archives are filled to the brim with reports and memorandum that are extensively notated by Presidents. Historians will pour over these notes to try to understand a Presidents thought process and decision making. 

Don’t defend this guys laziness by saying he has no time when Trump has golfed 372 days of the his presidency."

Lets have a look at some of those citation shall we?

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/30/who-proud-boys-group-mentioned-debate-has-violent-history/5868406002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/30/who-proud-boys-group-mentioned-debate-has-violent-history/5868406002/)

Current Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who is Afro-Cuban, says the group has ""longstanding regulations prohibiting racist, white supremacist or violent activity,"" Ronald D. Coleman wrote in an email to USA TODAY. Coleman said he is a spokesman for the Proud Boys.

""We do not care what color you are or what your background is ... if you love America ... we consider you a brother,"" Tarrio said in a written statement provided by Coleman. The group condemns racism, fascism, communism and socialism, the statement says.

Weird... why would a white supremacist have an Afro-Cuban leader? Why would they condemn racism in all its forms?

Why does the word of a single professor in michigan count as proof the PB are white nationalists?

[https://web.archive.org/web/20201002071342if\_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/30/proudboys1001/](https://web.archive.org/web/20201002071342if_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/30/proudboys1001/)

Here the Biden offering up the proud bpys as an example of a white supremacist group is apparently enough to make them that.  No other evidence is required.

[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/2/trump-denounces-all-white-supremacists-including-proud-boys](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/2/trump-denounces-all-white-supremacists-including-proud-boys)

Here Trump denoucnign white supremacy (again) and condemning the Proud Boys is used as proof the Proud Boys are racist. Despite Trump saying he does not know anything about the group. Why would that count as proof that the PB are white supremacists? Trump said he didnt know anything about them.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2020/10/02/trump-says-i-condemn-all-white-supremacists-days-after-giving-the-proud-boys-a-shout-out-on-the-debate-stage/#7d6c4998ef6a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2020/10/02/trump-says-i-condemn-all-white-supremacists-days-after-giving-the-proud-boys-a-shout-out-on-the-debate-stage/#7d6c4998ef6a)

Wow fighting with antifa is proof the Proud Boys are white supremacists. Talk about circular logic...

Why dont you do what I asked and give me evidence of the Proud Boys endorsing or engaging in white supremacist rhetoric?

Why didnt you provide any evidence at all of the Proud Boys being homophobic?

Quote a Proud Boy endorsing white supremacy.

Quote a Proud Boy endorsing homophobia.

Explain why the Proud Boys are lead by an afro-cuban american if they are a white supremacist group?

Explain why a white supremacist group would not only allow non white members but be lead by them.

Explain why a homophobic group would allow gay members and invite well known gay men to be speakers and guests of honor at their events.

Think ya can do that?"

1601850904.0|pics|verdifer|"> Joe Biden would do a good job, since Trump spent almost all of the debate attacking him on a personal level

Well I can't see into the future and my logic doesn't mean he will do a good job. But if Trump is attacking him on a personal level, in my mind it means he has very little to attack him on a work level i.e. policies, how he would govern etc etc. If the guys doing PR for Biden had any sense they would pick up on this and use it to their advantage. You don't need to like whoever is in charge on a personal level, but you do need to like what they are doing.

In respect to the problems you highlight with the Trump regime like ICE for example, ICE was created in 2003 by the Bush administration. As for leaving the Kurds, leaving behind those that helped you is something America does over and over, Iraq is an example where the regime after Saddam was allowed to kill folks who helped America without a thing said by anyone. 

People highlight the Obama years as if they were a success, when in fact they were an abject failure. If Obama was not a black man the view on him would be different. You said ""0 in eight years for Obama"", which I will take as being true, but how many children were killed by drone strikes in places like the villages in Pakistan, I have a friend from Pakistan and he says that these are 1 of the main reasons why the East hates America. If America thought a guy they were after was hiding in a village they would drone bomb it, many innocent people including women and children were killed. The Obama administration held the record for the most drone strikes and prob did more for terrorist recruitment than any video they made. And keep in mind may of these terrorist organisations were at some point funded or trained by US soldiers, you mention Russia but leave out how America funded the mujahideen with billions to kill Russians in the 70's/80's.

Now don't get me wrong here, I'm in no way defending Trump, but if you look at things - it's the same shit over and over with a different guy in the White House. When it came to Trump running for president the other option was a Clinton FFS, putting a Clinton up is as good as throwing a few million votes away. A country of 320 million people and this is the best 2 you could find. Do you really think Biden will make that much of a difference? 

I think Trump will win again, well I should rephrase that better ""I think the Democrats will lose again"" because like Trump v Clinton I come back to my ""a country of 320 million people and that's the best you can do"". The Democrats need to get a leader folks can relate to and fight Trump with their policies. Don't fight Trump on Social Media with personal attacks, fight him with policies - if folks choose to fight on Social Media they will lose as you are on his battleground."

But in my opinion ""having unlimited power"" does not equate to ""being able to do anything."" As an example solution, if God were to create a stone in a vacuum, in a universe completely free of any other object or force, there would be no frame of reference by which to discern ""up"" from ""down"". Taking the definition of ""lift,"" from Merriam Webster, as ""to raise from a lower to a higher position"", there would be no way to meaningfully designate any position as being lower or higher, and therefore, no mater how much power one has, and no matter how much force one exerts on the rock, one can not meaningfully lift the stone. Because the inability to lift the stone does not stem from a lack of power, the existence of such a stone does not preclude God from ""having unlimited power,"" or being ""Almighty,"" at least in that sense."

1601851465.0|science|HiroshiHatake|Well, the thing is, most people DO get vaccinated because they don't want their children to get the diseases in question. Any good pediatrician, who were all educated with similar standards, is going to vaccinate by default. It's just part of the schedule for the first couple of years of pediatrician visits which is usually set up by the time you leave a hospital after having a baby. And when most kids begin to go to school if they don't have their vaccinations by then the school requires a record of them, at least in the US, so they're really forced to get them if they are going to public school which is the majority of the US kids. Sure, there are exemptions for medical issues and for religion, etc, but even those things are such a pain in the ass that lazy people would rather just get the vaccinations. Even 30 to 60% of society being vaccinated is enough to slow or stop the spread of most viruses. We mostly achieve that through having standards in the schools.

Hanke, L., Vidakovics Perez, L., Sheward, D.J. et al. 

Nature Communications volume 11, Article number: 4420 (2020) 

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18174-5

Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through an interaction between the spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. Ty1 binds the RBD with high affinity, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 Å resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformations, sterically hindering RBD-ACE2 binding. While fusion to an Fc domain renders Ty1 extremely potent, Ty1 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus as a 12.8 kDa nanobody, which can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19."

Regarding the others, which are both great reads, I’d be curious to see the data corrected for potentially confounding variables like income level, educational attainment, location, etc, which could be the driving factor for some mothers drinking to begin with and better explain the outcomes.

We have no baseline of what could count as safe or what (outside of common sense) would dictate dangerous. Most doctors and governments recommend no alcohol at all because of the fact that we have very little idea of what constitutes 'safe'. The general stance is ""well if we don't know what IS safe, we should assume it isn't safe at all for the health and wellness of the baby."" It can lead to a lot of women feeling extreme guilt for drinking during the period of time that they were pregnant but not yet aware of that fact. It can also have a negative impact on the women that have cravings for alcohol during pregnancy.

My position is, unless you're binging, it's probably in line with lots of other semi-risky behaviors that we don't badger pregnant women over. I cut up a giant six-foot stump with a chainsaw at 24 weeks, I was scrubbing acetone (with a full face respirator, but still) at 38 weeks. I live in a smoggy city. I drive an older car.

You do not have the 'right' to drive a car on public roadways. you petition your local government for permission to operate that vehicle on the publicly owned roadways, and in exchange for that permission, you agree to follow the laws regarding that operation. This is known as voluntary participation. There is no right associated with operating a vehicle, or using it to travel on public roadways. Ergo, the powers that be, do have the authority to regulate that activity.

The  way you break this down is simple. Drop a person in the middle of the woods, naked, with no tools. What can they do? you can talk. you can eat. you can sleep. you can create makeshift clothing and wear it. you can make a makeshift domicile and live in it. they can craft weapons and use them to defend their life and property.

Although I will make a slight modification, and say that for efficiency's sake, instead of the device sitting at room temperature, it would be part of a heatsink assembly on a computer.

We can convert heat into electricity using thermal expansion (piezoelectrics between layers of material, perhaps something like this: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/773/1/012073/pdf). Mechanically removing heat from an object to charge a circuit seems perfectly plausible. There does have to be a temperature gradient for it to work, which is why I chose not to have the device just sitting on a table at room temperature, for comparison's sake.

Now, I will certainly admit that there is room to argue whether or not this energy transfer could be done on an atomic scale with a diode.

1601837655.0|science|DPJazzy91|Right now our only method for creating energy from heat is to run expanding gas or liquid through a turbine.  All the other methods are terrible.  graphene in general would be amazing for fusion reactors because you could use them for superconducting conduit for the electromagnets and you could use them for the shielding of the housing and if the heat harvesting can be improved they could be used to siphon energy off without having to connect the reactor to a turbine or something like that.  Their energy output is going to be pretty low though.  I highly doubt that the energy per square foot can get high enough to make it useful and something like a reactor.  I see it as more of an extra layer on solar panels to boost efficiency and get a little more energy out of them.  But mainly as uninterrupted constant power for some microelectronics in computers.

For instance, if you could print it inside circuit boards, you could use the power to retain data in ram chips.  It could prevent computers from losing the time when their onboard battery fails.  It could power low voltage sensors, so they never go offline. It could also be used to harvest additional heat out of exhaust from turbines, and other engines, or really any heat sources.  Print a layer of them underneath solar panels.  Use some of that heat to get more juice per square foot of panel.

1601835660.0|science|whatiwishicouldsay|"No heat difference (just some heat in general)

The whole circuit is kept at the same temp.

Apparently there was some detectable current (AC) even without the diodes. However the wattage was ridiculously low. Adding the diodes which would norally decrease efficiency of a  circuit, actually increased it because it allowed an electron concentration to build up enough to overcome the resistance of the wire.

Btw we are still likely talking about femtowatts of power. 

But because the actual size of the graphene would be inconsequential to the number of electrons tunneling the diode (because only the electron beside the diode matters) millions of these circuits could be combined in parallel theoretically to produce microwatts of power.

Here in lies the problem, unless your goal is to convert heat in to heat a micrometre away, you need an extremely efficient conductor (like more double layers of graphene) to transmit the electrons far enough to actually connect millions of these circuits in parallel, and have an abundance of them to do work with other than make more heat."

This is what's confusing to me. How are they generating cooling if everything in the system is in thermal equilibrium? They say there's thermal fluctuations in the graphene sheet, but if you're able to harvest energy from them you would be continually cooling the graphene sheet, similar to evaporation off of a puddle.

Are they actually getting some differential heating of the graphene sheet from light in the room or picking up energy from E&M waves in the environment?

>Exactly what I've been saying. These common sense notions in Asia are not based out of thin air after all.

They are based on problems they have faced in the past. It did not neccesarily mean they would translate well to covid at all.

&#x200B;

>Why do people wear surgical masks in hospitals?

Surgeons wear masks for a completely different reason, namely that if you operate on a patient, you need to protec the patient from the germs of the surgical team.

If you're asking why surgical masks are generally worn in hospitals during covid? Well, if you don't know what might help, you use anything you have available, not only limited to masks but also different protection like gloves etc.

&#x200B;

>If we followed the best science, such as the precautionary principle, we'd all be better off.

Sadly, we do not live in a world with infinite supplies. So you cannot simply use the tactic ""lets just use any precautionary action available"" for the whole population.

>Again false, you can't change publication dates to your narrative.

When did I name  or change a single publication date?  Studies about other diseases like the flu are a good starting point, but are no replacement for science that needed to be done on covid itself.

Also, 6 drinks a week is not what most would consider low-consumption. The article says most of this occurred in the first 6-7 weeks of pregnancy (so within 2-3 weeks of a missed period) before women knew they were pregnant. This would indicate they were drinking that amount regularly before pregnancy. I don’t know for sure, but I’d hazard a guess that people with more anxiety might be more prone to drinking.

Because if your name *doesn't* get called you're basically telling parents that their child's access to a free and appropriate public education is going to be curtailed - without parent consent. And there's the whole mindset of parents who see taxes and schools as being a transaction where they have purchased curtain outcomes. But parents aren't the clients of an educational institution, their kids are. 

 This is easier to handle of you say that all students of a particular class - say all students classified as at risk - are *guaranteed* a seat, and all non-at-risk (however a school wishes to define it) will remain in distance learning with no choice for a certain length of time. 

Otherwise you may end up with students whose situations are actually identical but have received a different outcome because one received a golden ticket and the other did not. I know some schools have done this lottery thing but I would be worried that a family would file suit if they didn't win - and have a shot of being correct on the merits of the case. Random may be fair in one sense but still be discriminatory in another. 

It'll also depend on the rules set in place by the state educational agency. Over here, the by-line is all instruction must be ""equivalent"" but need not be ""identical"" between distance learners and on campus students. This is a rule I know for a fact isn't required (or being enforced) elsewhere where distance learners are receiving a much watered down version of the curriculum compared to their on campus peers. 

So in short, I'm wary of the reasonableness of putting random chance in the driver's seat when it comes to ensuring **equity**, even if every child is being treated *equally* under such a lottery system. Those weighted criteria will only go so far."

Take states which don't have mask mandates and that have fully opened like Florida.  Your restaurants, bars and gyms can be open without concern. Sure cases might go up, but your banking on that the increased influx of people will offset the sick people and deaths that can't shop.

For the individual, compliance provides access to stores because many places do have mandates.

Many people avoid masks by wearing them incorrectly (not covering nose or sometimes even mouth) or by ""eating/drinking"" stuff slowly while they walk around places they need masks.  They are showing ""compliance"" but are not actually complying. 

So fake compliance gives you a ""monetary benefit"" of being able to shop in person and hang out with people without having the issues of proper compliance.  They also won't get fined (which is a ""law"" in some states and cities).  They effectively are taking the benefit of being protected from the majority who wear masks while putting everyone else at risk. They also avoid monetary damages for noncompliance.

It doesn’t change the fact that dealing with that behavior can be hard and emotionally draining. And that’s with a *family member.* When it’s a student, that’s only going to be harder to weather. It’s also worth noting that ODD is one of the hardest conditions to accommodate as a teacher, especially in an integrated classroom where appropriate support is often inherently disruptive to the rest of the class. It leads to a rather stressful experience for the teacher.

All that said, point to where ExtraDebit said they didn’t support their students. You can’t, because they didn’t.

For the most part, most people who are pregnant are doing their best and consulting with a medical team. It is extremely hard to meet rigorous or sometimes even basic facets of an ideal “healthy” diet while pregnant. For example, water can cause severe nausea and vomiting that will dehydrate you more than just having maybe half the water every day but in the form of ice chips that don’t make you vomit. Actual research is very important. Scientific evidence of the “advice” given to pregnant people should be evidence based and researched, not just what society thinks. Because society thinks pregnant people should do a lot of things, and are often not shy in announcing them in public to an adult.

Edit: also this article itself even defines low levels of alcohol as up to 6 drinks per week, so the people in this comment thread talking about judging  any consumption at all, a few drinks a week, etc. just read the headline and are using it to support what they already decided in their heads they should judge pregnant people for"

Not to mention all the cities in between WPB, Fort Lauderdale, and Miami that are all strongly blue and pretty high in population on their own. The southeast population of Florida is huge and very democrat. The republican population is far more spread out so any effect on specific geographic areas will usually effect them less based on that alone (assuming a concentrated democrate area is included at all, which they are and were).

And no, Miami is not mostly red on the coast. There are a few spots directly on the coast, mostly around pompano, less so Miami, where residential areas are less concentrated and the population is concentrated a little bit back from the coast.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse\_incentive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive)

Employers would spend a lot of time and wasted effort getting around a simple wage cap. They would have to find legal and grey area ways to pay people indirectly, be it through benefits, luxury office accommodations, company cars, ridiculous vacation allowances or duplicate staff. More than likely it would end up with a massive increase in the 'consultification' of many professions. You wouldn't have a CEO, you would pay a consulting fee to a business to lease a CEO for five years that would just be a huge wage cap avoidance scheme. 

It would turn getting paid into what paying taxes is, a hugely complicated nightmare that only the rich can afford to play. It would create a lot of waste in the system that management consulting law and accounting firms would love. 

This is similar to why exorbitantly paid CEOs are paid in stock options that are taxed at capital gains rates - and the most clever can even find a way to hold in tax free investment vehicles. Read about Mitt Romney's fortune."

1601852278.0|worldnews|jjnefx|"""I'm not an economist but I'm wondering if there's not more value to a country in trade than cash.""

Yes there is.  From an international trade standpoint, other importers will flock to you when trading is easier.  

Country A has few trade barriers.  But their product quality is 80% of country B.  
Country B has many inspection points, red tape, political agendas involved in trade.

If the price is equal, some will go with A some with B.  Once the price of A goes under B, importers will exponentially flock to country A.  

Now speaking of price.  China and Brazil both have the luxury of manipulating their currencies value.  The US floats theirs.  If you look at the Real vs Yen, in 2018 it was 2.4 to 1.  Today it's 1.19 to 1.  China has twice the purchasing power today as just a few years ago.

Chomsky also spread some false information about the atrocities being fewer and farther between than were widely reported, although he walked that back and apologized. He trusted sources that he shouldn't have. 

Ultimately that doesn't seem like a very fucking controversial take to me, tbh, and since at the time Chomsky was well aware of some of the other horrific shit the US was doing in the name of ""containment"" I'm hard pressed to even fault him for trusting his sources about the khmer rouge over official reports."

So, at this point, all Catholic charity (and discounting by 75% all the labor provided for free by a conservative estimate of religious) is at around $5billion and the Gates foundation around $5billion again in spending. 

Now, if I *just* include Catholic spending on hospitals in the US from the economist article, this will absolutely blow the Gates foundation out of the water. The economist estimates the Church spends $98.6 billion on healthcare, so that's $103 billion, *conservatively*, which absolutely dominates any charity on this list. I could continue, but it would just be unfair honestly. The Church is so large and has such a presence and has so many people working for it that it's just too hard to beat.

Pure capitalism would be making sure only one company could make flour via a monopoly and then making sure the flour contains as little actual flour as possible (50% rat waste by volume!) while charging the maximum price. 

Without regulation the corporate entities simply end up hiring military and police forces to suppress labor (see also your history books) or anyone else standing in the way of their profit and goals (see also current tech factories in poor far eastern nations).

Do you not see the problem here? Its my money it ought to be spent how I want it to. If its not spent how I want it to thats because someone took it and is spending it how they want. They are spending my money. Thats theft. 

I'm not saying I haven't reaped the benefits of taxes. Just like you, assuming you're in the US or somewhere that has amazon, have benefited from the convince of anything delivered to you. That being possible because of capitalism. But corporations asking for money and getting it, is not capitalism. Just like getting corporate tax breaks isn't capitalism. Im not saying capitalism perfect, but im also not condemning its existence and claiming im right and you're wrong. There is room for some middle ground. Thats typically where the answer lies in most situations. The only claim I've made, again, to be right is that taking something that is mine, against my will, no matter how it is used whether for good or bad. That is mine the government took it, I didn't want them to. Thats theft. If I take something of yours and I do good with it. I still stole it from you, its still theft. Theft is a deontological issue, its unethical to take something from someone against their wishes.

1601851844.0|worldnews|HAximand|"> If he is all powerful and all knowing, then why can't he figure out something as simple as free will as well as allowing him to fix problems?

This statement depends on what you mean by ""all powerful."" The Abrahamic religions generally consider God to be all powerful in that he created everything, he can destroy everything, he determined the laws of physics, and he can break the laws of physics. Never do any of these religions claim that God can break the laws of *logic.* 

In other words, God can cause one loaf of bread to split into two larger loaves of bread, but he can't make one loaf of bread that is actually two loaves of bread. Expecting God to find a way to both allow humans the option to do bad things, and simultaneously not allow bad things to happen, is like expecting God to make two plus two equal five.

I'm no philosopher, but I imagine that a more rigorous definition of this idea would have something to do with Plato's idea of the Realm of Forms as opposed to the Realm of Appearances. The Realm of Appearances is where we live. We have horses, and circles, and atoms, etc. The Realm of Forms is where only concepts live. It contains the idea of a horse, the idea of a circle, etc. The Realm of Forms contains the perfect circle. All circles we ever see in the Realm of Appearances aren't quite perfect - they'll just never be quite exactly 2pi radians. 

All this to say that I think what people mean by ""all powerful"" is that God has all power over the Realm of Appearances. It's not within God's power to change such a concept as the definition of a circle. What he can do, in this view, is set pi to be whatever value he wishes."

It absolutely is not. An economy is the ways in which a society distributes resource among it's population and the means through which it is achieved. Capitalism involves the private ownership over the means of production (land, factories, businesses, equipment, resources etc...) while socialism involves the democratic ownership of the means of production by those who labour under it. These are two opposed ideals.

You can have socialist institutions in a capitalism market economy and vis versa, but socialism is by definition **not a capitalist system.**

> Did you know we have a stock market in Canada too?

Did you know that stock markets are antithetical to socialism since it involves private ownership over the means of production and involves people being able to make passive income over something they invested no labour towards?

Economics have an effect on political institutions just as much as political institutions have an effect on the economy.

Deforestation was as bad in the 90's and early 00's, however that was before climate change was widely accepted and the effects of it were clear to see. With new scientific developments, deforestation rates reduced rapidly and significantly, up until Bolsonary came into office.

The main problem is the feedback loop though, and how the eventual loss of the Amazon will destroy the agricultural lands with extend periods of droughts and floods. The droughts in themselves will also destroy the Amazon, leading to more droughts and so on.

It is not that the media, and academics, hates the Bolsonaro government that is the problem. Ignore the media for now, even. Why would the academics go against Bolsonaro on this, if they didn't have reason? Shouldn't Bolsonaro and his government have trust in science, and the scientific models, both regarding the ecological and economical impact of the deforestation?

It seems to me that you're kinda agreeing with Bolsonaro to agree with Bolsonaro, and that's again where a critical eye might be important. As I said, I also had problems with the failings of my party before, but then I realized that holding them to a higher standard might not only be productive but also strengthen their political agenda in general."

You are trading the time you spent fishing for someone else's time they spent collecting the rice. You cannot just have that fish just magicaly exsist without putting in the work to catch it.

Compare, for example, the democracy of Greece to the imperialist Christian theocracy of Rome. That's a regression in terms of populist political control.

Or, for an entirely different context, compare the Christian monarchies to the participatory democracy of the Six Nations against whom they perpetrated a genocide.

Look at the Franco's Church-sponsored fascism in comparison to the completely anticlerical Revolutionary Catalonia. 

Look at Tsar Nicholas in comparison to the Soviet Union.

It goes on and on, and I make these comparisons as a Catholic and a communist. Christian nations do not have an historical track record of progressive humanitarian focus."

Hierarchy and inequality may be seen as natural results of traditional social differences or the competition in market economies.

> DEFINITION OF THE CHILD

>45. Chilean legislation provides no definition of the child. It does, however, clearly establish the age of majority, that is the full capacity to perform civil acts, at 21. In this connection it should be mentioned that a bill to lower the age of majority to 18 is being considered. Nevertheless, in accordance with the requirements of article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in Chile, a child means every human being below the age of 18 years.

>46. As a result, there is currently a contradiction between the provisions of the Convention and those of civil law, in particular the Civil Code, which stipulates in article 26 that ""anyone who has not reached the age of seven shall be considered an infant or child; a male below the age of 14 and a female below the age of 12 shall be considered below the age of puberty; anyone over the age of puberty shall be considered an adult; a person who has reached the age of 21 shall be considered of age, or simply a major, and anyone who has not reached that age shall be considered below legal age, or simply a minor.""

I didn’t try to make capitalism sound sexy. It just is what it is. Don’t deny your sexual orientation and what you’re attracted to because of ideology, bud. 

Innovation occurs through competition and adaptation. If you can make a product that is cheaper and better than previous products you have the strongest chance of being successful. That’s economics 101, pal. Innovation, much like evolution, can be a slow and painful process. This is proven through facts on the ground.... I mean reality. This is why the United States out competed and outlasted the communist Soviet Union. This is why China turned away from their failed Marxist policies and adopted state capitalism. China realized that famine, poverty, and mass death were bad results. They adapted. 

Exploitation of workers occurs/ed in every undeveloped (by modern standards) country. Communist countries have always had much worse living standards for workers. When the value of a worker increases their living standards increase. Unfortunately, this is a fact of life that has never been avoided. In the United States every ethnic group you mentioned is doing better today than they’ve ever done at any other time in history, and better than they’ve ever done anywhere in the world. Every group you mentioned is a success story for capitalism.

They reached their 2020 emission target 3 years early, actually doing what the paris agreement wanted. They’re committing to becoming carbon neutral and are reaching goals they set for that early. And their one party system makes this goal very realistic with their ability to get things done without political arguments. Anyway from a per capital point of view western people produce a significant amount more pollution. Especially when you consider we (western world) give all our trash and manufacturing jobs, two huge contributors to co2, to China and other Asian countries.

As for the West, at least the US has pulled out of the Paris climate deal and many states are going towards fracking and coal again. Our president denies climate change still and probably 30-50% don’t believe it. You can argue we “care” about it more but if we’re still arguing if climate change is real in 2020 I’m not sure if caring is enough.


Just because China is authoritarian doesn’t mean they don’t care about climate change, and when considering all manufacturing for our goods is done in China now, complaining about Chinas pollution when we are the ones benefitting from it seems a bit wrong. Especially since they’re committed to meeting the Paris climate deal goals."

That is a statement of justification, though.

It was incredibly dangerous to criticize capitalism in the US after WWII. There never has been a competition in the marketplace of ideas.

>Not a single intervention.

What about Chile? What about Vietnam?

>Consolidation of power is a problem by itself that has to be fixed via state.

Except this is all going exactly as predicted. Policies limiting private power were popular in the early 20th century. The idea of worker ownership was really popular after the industrial revolution among worker that didn't even know what socialism was. Normal people understood that the owners didn't have the best interests of workers at heart and their power in society was a detriment. Where are we in 2020 after decades of corporations owning every media product that people consume? Democratizing capitalism is an extremist position that will get you labeled a *marxist-leninist* by most people who consider themselves moderate. The state converting Amazon into a coop is considered tyrannical by most people, due to decades of propaganda that taught people to believe that you should thank your boss if you have a job and you should blame the government if you lose it(Anti-Politics).

>It's not ""infinite growth"" it's ""whatever growth we can get with the amount of wealth resources give us"".

And what we're headed for is a situation where all of these resources are owned by a few corporation. There can't be infinite growth, eventually there's no pie left and 99% of people are serfs."

As a tourist, you can generally trust the police or shopkeepers to help out when in trouble.

One safety measure I always advise single women to take is to make people aware that you have tour guard up. For example, when you get in a cab, take a photo of the number plate of the can in such a way that the driver sees you taking it and sending to a friend over whatsapp. Typically that will keep the driver in good behaviour at all times."

is just wildly incorrect. Capitalism isn't some sexy Darwinian only the canniest and best survive game. It's a game of exploitation. Capitalism hates innovation and only does so under great duress (look at medicine and energy for instance) although yeah you do see innovation in smaller scales like local food or entertainment(industries both known for their brutal exploitation of their workers)

Capitalism has *sometimes* been good for *some* people but only when it has TONS of brakes through regulation and unions. And even then was very bad for many many people(if you are American, see: black people, Italians, Irish, Germans, Women, people that didn't own land.. ect)

Just like elephants, they're plentiful enough to be nuisance animals in some areas."
1601850209.0|worldnews|hanafraud|"Not op,but I’ll give a generic example of African conservation through hunting. It’s obviously much more nuanced than this, but here is the summary. Hunter wants to kill an elephant. Hunter has to go through the government to purchase a tag. An elephant tag is somewhere between 100k-500k dollars (depending on where). That money is specifically allocated towards conservation of the species that the tag was bought for. Then, in many African countries, the hunter has to pay the land owner for the right to hunt his animals (in many African countries, land owners own the animals). Once the hunter has paid the land owner, and the conservation department, now the hunter has to hire a guide (10-100k dollars). Altogether, an elephant can cost a Hunter up to a million dollars, which in Africa is a significant part of their economy. 

But it’s more than just the money. In many parts of Africa, the land owners own all the animals on their land. These animals can be very harmful to plants and livestock on their land and can become a nuisance—one that is removed by poaching (to which the land owner will turn a blind eye towards) or poison (by the landowner himself). But, when the animals on their land become a source of income, all of the sudden the land owner *doesnt* want all the animals gone and will take great lengths to protect the animals from poachers, even going so far as to hire guards (note: further economic gain) 

So hunting as a form on conservation serves multiple purposes: first, it is a big economic contributor. People argue that sight seeing is a more substantial contributor, and they may be right, but often other things are not taken into account (land owner tags, taxidermy, guides, wildlife guards, housing, food, transportation, etc.)

Second, it provides incentives for land owners to actively resist poaching instead of turning a blind eye towards it. 

Third, very often the meat is not shipped home and is instead given to the villagers to eat. This may sound like wontan waste, but it is sometimes required to be this way by the government to feed their people.

Lastly, and this is a part that a lot of people have a hard time understanding, oftentimes hunters are huge proponents of the animals they hunt. They spread awareness, fund private conservation groups, donate time and money to projects, create media that further spreads awareness and love for these animals, and pay for activities such as sightseeing and safaris to view these animals when they’re not hunting them.

Edit: spelling. Also, sorry for the book’s worth of writing."

You want Americans to take that position but the adherence to short term profits and Keynesian economic theory have promoted the idea of increased educational costs for students to shoulder the burden of with no increase in the quality of education that they’re getting. They have to go through years of schooling and take loans with insane interest rates for the chance of entering a field, like the medical field for example, that has insane hours with little compensation outside of niche expert fields. You say them at we spend more on education than anyone else but that spending is not increasing the quality of education or the supplies given to the students, it’s only increasing the profits that these schools, administrations, and predatory loan companies increase. Now take that some mode of predatory profiteering and apply it to every sector of the economy. 

Then you have the poor students who never even have the opportunity to explore those fields because although a select few may receive full scholarships their community and family situation requires them to take the first paying position possible and keep it because they don’t have the privilege to look for something better or further education because they need to keep working to support their families because those social benefits are not enough to even pay rent in any state in the union

The worst part was that it gained momentum directly after 9/11. Sam Harris wrote at length about the benefits of racial profiling, torture, and preemptive nuclear strike on a ""hypothetical"" Muslim nation about to obtain nuclear arms.

Their followers popularized dog whistles like ""Islamophobia isn't racism because Islam isn't a race.""

The core narrative of New Atheism was fundamentally the same as Neoconservatism: that we are the torchbearers of the tradition of Western Civilization and must protect it against external threats by force. But, because they separated it from the religious rhetoric of the right, people failed to recognize it as reactionary, and the movement was able to recruit an untold number of insecure logic nerds going through their cynical phase."

Of course the pope is more interested in the welfare side of the equation. That would be appropriate for the pope.   

So, the reason a certain person got elected was because the middle of a continental sized country was paying taxes that benefit the more populous coasts and losing jobs to foreign countries because they couldn’t compete with lower wages.  You could put in universal healthcare and it wouldn’t help the people in flyover country because there’s no hospital to go to within 100 miles or more in some places.  To get a benefit, they need to receive more per capita resources because of the vast distances involved and low average wages and they need more capital investment not less. So why should they pay into such a system? There’s a big risk of the beneficiaries of such a system being the beneficiaries of everything else - coastal cities, and they’d lose even more jobs.

I’ve always hated cheaters and when I found out he was married I was absolutely furious and disgusted with him. At that point we didn’t even do anything, he just flirted with me at work (we worked together at a restaurant) we didn’t have each phone numbers or anything. Well I would talk to him or even look at him for a while and then some how and for some reason over time he got me to laugh at his jokes and we became friendly again and well one thing lead to another. It was awful of me and when I look back at it I can’t believe I did something like that. I don’t have a reason why I did it, just know that it won’t ever happen again. 
But basically I lost respect for myself and all my friends. They didn’t know this man at all but they were disgusted with my actions. I can’t change the past but I can make sure it doesn’t happen again. 
The wife knows, me and her talked for like 2 months everyday and it’s a thing he does all the time. she hates me obviously but I guess she doesn’t hate me as much anymore cause we’re cool. She’s still with him and he’s still out there cheating, I don’t work with him anymore."

Imagine this: Team starts at their own 20. 1st down no gain. 2nd down no gain. 3rd down, 30-yd pass attempt, incomplete, but: PASS INTERFERENCE, DEFENSE, BALL PLACED AT SPOT OF THE FOUL. So now the team has the ball at the 50 from gaining absolutely no yards at all, just because the penalty ""placed the ball at the spot of the foul"".

Then from the 50: 1st down no gain, 2nd down no gain, 2rd down another 30-yd pass attempt, incomplete, but oh no PASS INTERFERENCE PLACE BALL AT SPOT OF FOUL. So now they have the ball at the 20-yd line from doing nothing at all, just riding 60 yards JUST from the penalties.

Now they have the ball at the 20. 1st down no gain 2nd down no gain 3rd down they attempt the endzone but OH NO PASS INTERFERENCE BALL PLACED AT ONE YARD LINE AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. So now they have the ball at the 1, from doing absolutely nothing at all, they just rode penalties to get there. Then they take 3 downs to punch in 1 yard and get a touchdown.

Most people don’t know that endo affects the immune system. Honestly the first several doctors I saw over the years were SO misinformed about endometriosis.

On the one hand, websites like Reddit and 4chan do represent the public and citing them for information regarding journalism is becoming more common.

On the other hand, they're letting redditors do the hard work of producing the content, then just picking the already voted cream of the crop and repackaging it with minimal effort.

Overall, fairly negative. But then again, there are youtube channels which consist of ""pretty girl, doing regular things and videoing it while occasionally talking about interesting things"" or ""gamer guy plays horror game and has massive overreactions to everything he sees"" which proceed to gets thousands of views daily. So really are we more ticked off at the youtubers, or the people who upvote them?"

Then from the 50: 1st down no gain, 2nd down no gain, 2rd down another 30-yd pass attempt, incomplete, but oh no PASS INTERFERENCE PLACE BALL AT SPOT OF FOUL. So now they have the ball at the 20-yd line from doing nothing at all, just riding 60 yards JUST from the penalties.

Now they have the ball at the 20. 1st down no gain 2nd down no gain 3rd down they attempt the endzone but OH NO PASS INTERFERENCE BALL PLACED AT ONE YARD LINE AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. So now they have the ball at the 1, from doing absolutely nothing at all, they just rode penalties to get there. Then they take 3 downs to punch in 1 yard and get a touchdown.

1601864892.0|AskReddit|irsquareamads|I had a similar incident, but with my sister.   We were latch key kids (this was 1982) and I was around 12.  We were playing backyard football with our friends and I had the ball.  One of the other guys tackled me from behind and caused me to fumble.  As I was pushing off the ground to recover the ball, another friend jumped on it and my arm at the same time.  I heard the pop of my bone and felt the pain.  My sister, of course, insisted I was faking it and made me sit at the kitchen table until my parents got home from work, which was about 3 hours.  So my dad comes home and sees my arm about twice it's normal size and takes me to the hospital.  It was indeed broken and I got a free souvenir cast!  The fun part - the hospital was LITERALLY across the street from my house, you could see it out through the kitchen window.  Gotta love family.

I had to have a surgical kneecap realignment (also called tibial tubercle osteotomy and elevation).  The surgery went great and I was home within 3 days.   About 48 hours of being home I got thirsty and needed to go to the fridge.   The issue though is I'm the 2nd floor and the fridge is on the first.  But whatever,  I had crutches and I started making my way down the flight of stairs.   I made it about 4 steps down, when all of a sudden my cat flew right by my crutches and startled me.  I fell face forward down 24 steps and during the fall my legs bend completely back.  I heard this awful zipper noise from the leg which I come to find out was the staples (80 of them) ripping out of my surgical wound.   I completely black out on the bottom of the stairs and come to with my cat looking at me.   I have these immobilizers on my leg so I just compress the leg tighter and get up.   Again, thinking I didn't really screw my leg up.   I end up getting my drink and go back upstairs.   Not knowing how much damage I have done I lay down and take a nap.   About 2 hours after my mom wakes me up screaming and I look down and my stabilizer and bed completely red.  They call and ambulance who took me to the hospital and when I saw my Artho he said something I never heard another doctor say.  Are you a FUCKING IDIOT!  YOU ALMOST DIED TODAY!

Result - I ended up breaking 3 different areas including knee cap in half.  The zipper noise was actually all the stitches came out.   I also started getting and infection and almost like 2 pints of blood due to one of screws going into a vein or something.

Lesson learned?  Nothin, I was thirsty."

Because it's proven to be effective and I don't believe doctors that talk about demon sex in dreams and bleach. That isn't science, that isn't medicine. I also didn't need the media to tell me any of that, I have a memory, I remember how SARS put the world in panic mode for a minute way back when. Precaution should never be labeled as paranoia. Masks seem self explanatory, as most of Asia adopted their use during the afformentioned prequel epidemic. 

I'm not the brightest knife in the old toolbox, but I do have some common sense. It's not about control, the government gassing and beating its own citizens is about control. This is basic decency during a global pandemic. I also long ago moved past the whole conspiracy mindset. The world is a disorganized shitshow, most everyone's just grinding to get by, not everything is a fucking conspiracy. Yet the internet goes wild, calls it a plandemic, anti-maskers spread their disinformation across every social media platform, and can't seem to fathom the idea that they're protecting other people. Like *what the fuck, America.*

I see why psychologists said that people who refuse to wear masks exhibit signs of psychopathy or sociopathy. There's *no regard* for the well being of others, *whatsoever*. They think everyone's a sheep, which is a reg flag word in-and-of itself. It's some frightening delusional thinking. Hell, I know a person who has labeled everyone who wears masks as mentally ill. That shit stings like all hell. The world is burning and nobody seems to be able to muster a fuck."

1601864840.0|AskReddit|MeX1canBurrit0|Not neccesarily. This is why their is a food chain. Because different animals over power others but in the grand scheme of things that is what keeps the balance. If one animal was to have no real predator the scale would tip more towards one side and all would follow. Weak and defenseless is too subjective to generalize. For example worms thrive but they all  are weak and defenseless to virtually every creature, in comparision rats and mice would take over all the worms and they would cease to exist but hawks fly down and eat the rats and mice thus keeping balance so that way everything in this world lives and when its time is to die out it will do so when the conditions are right. A baby elephant is still a baby but has the power to stomp over and kill a human if it needed to. At some point when we were closely like apes even being an infant was hard but we had are advantages just like baby elephants do ,its why we have survived so long and haven't died out since or been over taken by another species.

1601864834.0|AskReddit|DrossDespondent|"Over 4,000 know religions, how can only one be correct? Yet, if I believed every story I heard, I wouldn't even be able to walk down the street without fear of the sky falling. You know, Jesus wasn't the only one who claimed to be the child of God. Jim Jones faked his ability to heal physical afflictions with faith alone, he claimed it was because he was the son of God. It ended in a litany of abuse and the mass suicide of numerous men, women, and children. That is not a unique story, it had happened before and it happened after. At some point, you have to realize that the stories were created out of self-interest. 

Furthermore, any God could only exist outside of all known laws of physics and chemistry. The first law of thermodynamics, the law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed - only converted from one form of energy to another. 

Early in the 20th century, Einstein figured out that even mass is a form of energy (this is called mass-energy equivalence). The amount of mass directly relates to the amount of energy, as determined by the most famous formula in physics: E=mc2. Yet, God is told to have created the world and man out of sheer willpower. He is always, He is whatever mass or energy he chooses to be. He exists outside of the system, perpetuated only by our magical thinking. 

There are very specific biological process in the brain that cause thought to occur. In order for your brain to think, you need nerve cells that can detect information about the outside world and can transmit that information to other nerve cells. It’s the transmission of information, the cells talking to each other, that’s the fundamental physical basis for how thinking works. When a single neuron fires, it is an isolated chemical blip. When many fire together, they form a thought. By extension, the whole brain is also an electrochemical machine. The neurons are connected in enormous networks. The receiving neuron registers the chemical signal and converts it to a new electrical signal, which is computed in the neuron's central body. 

One to five minutes after death, the brain is hit by a process called terminal spreading depolarization (SD) – or, in less scientific terms, a “brain tsunami”. In its most basic form, this is a wave of neuron activity that starts in the deeper brain structures and radiates outwards, unlike the previous burst of neuron activity, which hits all areas of the brain simultaneously. Importantly, it signifies the breakdown of the brain’s electrochemicals (the substances responsible for keeping our neurons alive and functioning) and marks the point at which the capacity for brain function and awareness are lost. 

When brain activity has ceased, thought continuing to occur would defy the law of conservation of energy in both physics and chemistry. Meanwhile, the blood forms clots, the fat liquefies, and the corpse turns a lovely green color. All the while, the body’s enzymes continue to digest its own organs. Those without much fibrous content (such as the brain) will be the first to go. Those with more fiber (like the heart and uterus) will stick around longer. 

The rotting body is becoming a sweet home for flies, maggots, and other insects. “Almost from the moment of death, or even before in some cases, flies will lay eggs on the body – usually around the nose, mouth, and eyes, and maggots will hatch and begin to consume the body,” Hamilton told IFLScience. By day seven, the greedy grubs are able to consume up to 60 percent of the corpse. 

As decomposition proceeds, anaerobic bacteria primarily within the intestinal tract, produce gases resulting in bloating followed by the purge of fluids and subsequent release of nutrients and microbes into the underlying soil. 

These processes of decomposition are the conservation of energy at work. The total energy remains constant, and is conserved over time. That is evident, at no point does your brain teleport to some mystical realm where you get everything you want. The biological processes in your brain, no longer have a place to occur. Just as a God has no system to support his ethereal existence. 

Furthermore and to quote Epicurus, ""Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"""

The only true statement you could make is that the dogs in two cartoons you could think of and another you couldn't were great Danes. that  would not be much of a statement, but it would be true.  They way you worded it is just plain false, there are many old school cartoons with many different breeds of dogs and great Danes are no more common than other breeds.

Your original statement:
The only cartoon dog from old school cartoons like The Jetsons, Scooby-Doo, Clifford, (one other old cartoon that ive forgotten now) that isn't a great dane is Clifford."

Hours away from it) and so the dude goes ""so are you guys visiting a family member?"" Because none of us, especially me, were acting like anything was actually about to happen. And so I replied with ""nope I'm the one having the procedure"" and he said ""you are the calmest person going into a heart procedure I've ever met""

Oh also, a month beforehand, when we found out I had WPWS, I was rushed to the hospital for my heart rate being over 217 or something and all like 7 of the doctors with me in my hospital room loved me cause all I did was talk about how I'm happy to be missing classes and that I didn't do my geometry hw the night before.

1601864688.0|AskReddit|nothingbeatagoodshit|I recently have been talking to a psychologist. And I have gotten a new job due to Covid in a field I’d never considered before. I’m still drowning in debt and I’m such a cynical twat that I just really told the psychologist what they wanted to hear to make the session go quicker. But my life is still a bit better. Everything I’m doing is my decision. I’m doing the job well. I’m cleaning and doing what adults are supposed to do. I feel like perhaps I do deserve to be happy or feel affection at some point. The pessimist part of me says I’ll get diagnosed with terminal cancer the second I allow myself any internal peace. But at least I’m not thinking about how the world would be better off if I was dead anymore. It makes me feel a little taller. I guess that’s something.

My old doctor canceled the Synthroid completely after running all kinds of heart function tests (echocardiograms are really freaky to watch when your heart is literally skipping beats) and diagnosed V-fib made worse by stress and overmedication.  Oddly, blood tests a few months later showed all my thyroid markers as fine.  I guess the shock of too much Synthroid made the gland stop overproducing TSH- just had to scare the heck out of me to do it.

Now, I have a lot of the symptoms of hypothyroidism, but none of the markers in my blood.  So the doc just keeps checking whatever she can think of and I just make do."

The two weeks that I was sick are very difficult to remember. I remember crying in pain at one point and seriously believing I was going to die. My boyfriend didn't fare much better. We're both very very fortunate that we're young and have good health. Not everyone makes it, and not everyone is lucky enough to be unscathed afterward like us.

This is a good question cuz us humans get so distracted with our phones, the internet, video games, etc. that we forget how truly blessed we really are cuz we’re so caught up with this nonsense when we should be giving our undivided attention to our friends and family, our homes and our pets, they love us so much and only want us to succeed but all we wanna do is browse the web

I like that meek mill song I think “blue notes” when he says you gotta take your self outside your body and look at yourself from the outside...really examine yourself and see who you truly are and once you get this view, make the necessary changes in your life to better your life for yourself and the ones around you"

Once everyone realized, they ran to her and the first thing she said after coming to was “ow, my back kinda hurts”. She just wanted to get up and stretch because she thought that was the problem so everyone held her down until the helicopter arrived. One of the guys taking down info during the ride told us that when he asked allowed to the others “does anyone know this girl’s social?”, she lifted her head and correctly and casually gave the man the number, even while being severely concussed along with broken ribs, cracked vertebrae, and a punctured lung.

1601864655.0|AskReddit|Awesomejuggler20|I've been driving for about 4 and a half years and I drive daily so I do have a little experience. Use your turn signal EVERY SINGLE TIME you make a turn no matter what (yes this includes in a parking lot). It's illegal to not signal a turn. Your signal is there for a reason. Not for a decoration. It's my driving pet peeve when people don't signal. Especially if I'm behind them. Also, if you're turning left at a flashing green light.... Do NOT make your turn if the light is no longer flashing and there's oncoming traffic. Once the light goes green for the oncoming traffic, they have the right of way. Not you. Unless you have plenty of time to make your turn before the oncoming light turns green, don't make your turn. If I'm turning left at a flashing green light, doesn't matter if I'm in the intersection already or not, if my light stops flashing green and is just solid green, I will stop and yield to oncoming traffic even if they haven't started going yet. I'll stop in the middle of the intersection if I have to. Can't count the amount of times I've been cut off by driver's ignoring the fact my light went green and they just turn right in front of me as if they still have the flashing light. Happened twice this weekend actually. Once yesterday and once tonight. Last but not least.... If you're turning left at a solid green light and there's a vehicle in the oncoming lane turning right, the vehicle turning right has the right of way. Not you. Only time you would have the right of way is if your light was flashing green.

https://www.handicappedpets.com/blog/ivdd-in-dogs/

My statement wasn't meant to disparage corgis, but to say that short-legged dogs are definitely prone to certain illnesses. Dachshunds are the prime example of this.

I don't know about incidence of disease (of any kind) in corgis. I do think that when 1/4 of dogs is experiencing a certain problem (like dachshunds) you should seriously reconsider the continuation of the breed, especially when the traits causing the problem are largely present for the sake of aesthetics. (Dachshunds aren't actually hunting badgers any more.)

Personally, I think it would be nice if everyone stopped breeding dogs... but I understand that that's not really reasonable and that not all dog breeds are equally as unethical. Bulldogs, dachshunds, and cavalier spaniels are the worst offenders as far as I know."

English bull terrier: 100 years ago they looked normal, but now we recognize their egg shaped noses. This may cause problems for the health as well

The dachshunds you see today are the same as the ones that were hunting badgers. As I said in another comment, 20-25% of dachshunds develop IVDD, which leads to very painful spinal problems and possible paralysis. I highly doubt that was the case when they were still a working dog.

I'll also mention that I recently adopted (what appears to be) a dachshund mix from the local shelter. She's a wonderful animal, but I can't imagine why someone would support the continuation of a breed with such common, severe, and painful problems."

1601863252.0|aww|anassakata|"The image is from a licensed wildlife rehabber in upstate NY who goes by fuzzyfawnwildlife on Instagram. She rescues fawns from a variety of situations over the course of the spring and summer (stuck in a fence, mom hit by a car, improperly 'rescued' by people) and provides care for them at her barn. She is required to release them in the fall except late birthed fawns so she tranqs them and moves them to a more secluded area near her friend's property so they have a good chance of avoiding people and don't come back to her barn, and releases them together so they'll have a better chance of getting through the winter. This was her most recent release, I believe.

She has a few fawns she's been allowed to 'winter over', including one who's basically BFFs with a rabbit she nursed back to health. I've learned a lot from her posts about how to treat wildlife, and frankly a lot about how much time and effort is involved. She does a full-time job of this and doesn't get paid. A very cool lady."

1601862684.0|aww|sp1d3_b0y|That’s not a fat fingered mistake, for one. Two, your entire point was *overstimulation*. Which is still easily solvable. Source: i have severe ADHD and i get overstimulated quite easily. I also called you a jackass because you’re an insulting person, not because of your information. You’ve quite literally only been insulting me and others throughout this entire thread. You’ve called many others and me ignorant, dumbasses, idiots, as well as more. As i said. You’re being downvoted because you’re *rude.* Not to mention that the article you posted isn’t correct nor does it have proper sources. Tickling allows a developing body to garner some sense of space, where their body is as well as more. It’s the reason why throwing your kid 10 feet into a lake is enjoyable and fun.

My pets and purse, of course; then I packed a suitcase with some clothing, toiletries/meds, my laptop and iPad + chargers. Also put my jewelry box and viola by the suitcase, if there was room for them too.

Don’t have insurance since I’m a renter... it’s possible my renter’s insurance is still active, since it was tied to my auto insurance, but I haven’t checked in a while. Probably should do that. But it doesn’t cover much, and making claims on individual items is complicated. Learned that after a small flood in my old apartment! I mean, who keeps paper receipts for every item they own?

There was a fire chief that told people to leave any fawns on their porch and not interact with them because the does will go back when the fire has passed to collect them knowing human homes are usually attempted to be saved from fires so it’s less likely to burn than the surrounding area

The munchkin gene is dominant, so breeding them at all - inbred or not - has the same effect of creating more cats with harmful genetic defects just because we find it cute.

So yeah, to be precise inbreeding isn't the issue here but it has the exact same outcome as inbreeding pets for these kinds of traits."

1601861140.0|aww|zachzsg|Fawns operate differently than adult deer. It’s very common in the wild for the mother to just leave a fawn in a spot for hours at a time, and they evolutionarily know not to move basically no matter what. Deer are also pretty dumb, so they’re probably just assuming the rescuer is their mother.

Amazing creatures

I mean, as far as I know, it started like this.

but then human idiots thought that it is cute and bred these so-called munchkin cats on purpose. creating cats that lose so much mobility and vitality. and have serious health issues.

and people who think that this is cute are actively looking for this breed and create a demand. 

and now the munchkin cat is an official breed

yeay..."

1601864426.0|funny|Phillip__Fry|"> I’ve been in hundreds of attics, and I’ve never seen a situation like that.

It should be obvious they aren't part of the truss (if truss attic).

My attic has some loose 2x4s that the contractors have broken off that are now laying on the sheetrock.

Basically, at construction, the lazy builders put 2x4s connecting between the trusses (not at floor level), with many of the ""nails"" meant to hold them in actually not connecting the 2x4 to the truss(es).  So they come off, since they only had a nail barely caught in one place."

(Edit: you may be wondering why I let them come back. The answer is they are cheap and always fix the problem in the end. They had the whole section of the ceiling patched and popcorned and painted, and waived all the bills for service.)"

I use the thicker-style freezer ziploc bags but recently invested in some reusable gallon bags. Never had an issue with freezer burn.

Pinterest is my go-to for new recipes. Peppers and onions are delicious just cooked on the stovetop or grilled with a bit of oil, salt and pepper."

They like to put a job they themselves admit should take 2-3 hours into an hour timeslot and shrug when you get behind. Regardless of whatever a corporate moron says, the companies themselves are responsible for fostering the mentality contractors and even in-house technicians have in regards to things like this. “Company doesn’t give a fuck about me, why the fuck should I care how their customers perceive them?”

I say this as somebody who was the guy that would go behind these people and fix the things customers had issue with. It was easy to get upset with the twat I was cleaning up after, but after awhile I couldn’t help but feel sympathetic. 

Corporate America is a cesspool of people making decisions about work they are entirely out of touch with if they ever knew anything about it in the first place."

When you resume the video, you only get the video-resume single ad and skip the ad roll. Sometimes it takes two tries, but it works in less time than watching all their crappy ads. Previous versions had other tricks, too (using another app/locking your phone for a minute during the first ad, then coming back and letting it finish after the ad roll timer in the background expired, closing the app right as the loading wheel 'skipped' when switching to the ad roll then re-opening the app now that the ad roll bit was marked 'watched', etc. - and the exploits cycled depending on what oversight in the code was active that month). Another exploit right now while watching on 4G signal is repetedly pausing and force-playing with brief pauses while the ad roll is struggling to load. Once the video starts playing smooth (without auto-pausing), you can switch back to wifi and the ad roll won't play.

If you must do attic work, the ""drywall"" that makes your ceiling is not fit for walking on. Ask anyone with family members with anger issues how easy it is to punch a hole through the drywall on your walls. To move in an attic you must move along the supporting joists that make up the actual structure of the house. These are two by fours, often buried under insulation.

As long as a guard didn't see you do it, the residents of the home wouldn't even speak up about it. And then, if you did get seen by the guards, they level scale so high that it is functionally completely impossible to beat them, regardless of how strong you are.

There aren't very many good F2P games, though. If you can afford it, the best/cheapest option would be to get a Series S ($300), and subscribe to Gamepass Ultimate ($15/mo).

Sonic 06 was rushed by a whole year, and quite frankly Secret Rings can be considered worse, but even still Modern Sonic has recovered fairly well from those titles between Unleashed's daytime sections, Colors, Generations, even Lost World on Wii U maybe. Mania is Classic so that doesn't count. Forces.... was a stumbling point, I'll admit, but still, it's not awful. Boom wasn't even made by Sonic Team/DIMPS, that was Big Red Button and Sanzaru, and even then, Sanzaru's second Sonic Boom game fixed the issues of the first.

1601863758.0|gaming|HobbesTech|"I'M SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS!! Ever since the original mountain update where they made it so biomes can change on the vertical axis, I have been desperately hoping for this day to come. Sure it doesn't have everything I've been wanting, but this is still something to finally get me interested again!! 

What I had truly wanted was additional depth, a few more tiers of metals interspersed (along with maybe a higher ceiling and lower floor of ability/speed?), and much more unique and varied generation. If it was a lot deeper, the generation could even vary a lot more at the different depths. That would all truly make me jump back in.

Why is this important to me? Well, essentially all I do in minecraft is mine. I build a little house, I farm, I get animals, I go to the nether, sure. But 90% of my time is spent down in the mines, exploring caves, gathering materials, making little rest points. It's what is most fun to me. And sadly that loop hasn't changed almost at all since the day I started playing. Sure the underground generation changed a little once or twice, but that's it. In fact, a number of additions, such as hunger, actually made it worse, since it required me to not stay down as long, it interrupted my favorite part. Hence why I stopped right before hunger was added.

For the past few years I've mused jumping back into Minecraft, but the lack of anything meaningful (or at all) changing to what I like has prevented me. Now though?

Now with that change, now I (well, soon at least) will actually have to."

1601861499.0|gaming|densetsu86|"Well if he prefers playstation then you get him a ps5. 

I see people keep arguing for gamepass. While its (for now) good for players, Sony has a compelling enough competition to that. Psnow. 9.99 a month or $60 for the year. Add that

Psnow yearly + Ps+ yearly = 120. So 120 vs 180 from game pass. That's $60 cheaper and you get psnow for pc and playstation with ps+. Ps+ on ps5 gives you instant game collection and ps+ collection. 

Psnow is 1 price and includes the service for playstation and pc. For pc it's all streaming. For playstation you can stream or download. You also get access to 800+ games. Those games include ps2 on ps4 which can be downloaded or streamed. Ps3 which is streaming only. Ps4 which can both be streamed or downloaded.

Now current ps now does not support mobile device (there is no mention that this will not or will happen sometime down the road, it's just currently ps and pc). 

And the other difference is no day 1 games. 

So psnow has 800+ vs gamepass 300+. 

Psnow with ps+ is 120 yearly vs gamepass 180 a year.

Psnow no day 1 vs gamepass some day 1

Pc and ps included vs more expensive option only for pc and xbox.

Psnow can stream games to the playstation vs gamepass cannot stream to xbox. All games must be downloaded on xbox so you need the space.

Also psnow streaming is on par with gamepass. Since they both use azure. 

Psnow is in 19 countries and gamepass with streaming is in 22 without streaming in 46.

So both have their pros and cons. Both are good deals with amazing values."

The game is relatively old, coming out in 2018 and it's only like $6, and it's on Mobile for free but you can pay to upgrade it. The game is pretty fun, especially with friends for how simple it is.

If I'm not mistaken it's probably loosely based on an old Starcraft Custom map that was a ton of fun called Infection which had a similar concept."

We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

The principal told me they couldn't allow me to wear that shirt because it encouraged fighting, which was against school rules.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

> Sly & the Family Stone were an important and influential band from Vallejo, California, United States. Active from 1966 until 1975, the band was pivotal in the development of soul, funk and psychedelia. Headed by singer, songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist Sly Stone, and containing several of his family members and friends, the band was the first major American rock band to have an integrated lineup in both race and gender.

> Brothers Sly Stone and singer/guitarist Freddie Stone combined their bands (Sly & the Stoners and Freddie & the Stone Souls) at the end of 1966. Sly and Freddie Stone, trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, drummer Gregg Errico, saxophonist Jerry Martini, and bassist Larry Graham completed the original lineup; Sly and Freddie's sister, singer/keyboardist Rose Stone, joined within a year. This collective recorded five Top 10 hits and four groundbreaking albums, which greatly influenced the sound of American pop music, soul, R&B, funk, and hip hop music. In the preface of his 1998 book For the Record: Sly and the Family Stone: An Oral History, Joel Selvin sums up the importance of Sly & the Family Stone's influence on African American music by stating ""there are two types of black music: black music before Sly Stone, and black music after Sly Stone"". The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.
During the early 1970s, the band switched to a grittier funk sound, which was as influential on the music industry as their earlier work. The band began to fall apart during this period because of drug abuse and ego clashes; consequently, the fortunes and reliability of the band deteriorated, leading to its dissolution in 1975. Sly Stone continued to record albums and tour with a new rotating lineup under the ""Sly & the Family Stone"" name from 1975 to 1983. In 1987, Sly Stone was arrested and sentenced for cocaine use, after which he went into effective retirement.

1601858029.0|Music|lowfreq33|The Pretender by Jackson Browne produces pretty much the same feeling. That sense that your life is basically over, you’ll never feel true joy again, and you’re just going through the motions until you die.

1601857826.0|Music|yoortyyo|If we’re going to have or need a heroic myth,  Captain America stacks fairly well.  He’s been written as woke as anyone.  MCU and Chris Evans mostly nailed it. Tony Stark finds his humanity.  Steve Rogers is born broken physically only.  His arc makes him whole.  He gets to have the super abilities that equal a super human spirit.

1601857482.0|Music|dontgive_afuck|Totally! Even though it's an EP, that's probably my favorite album of theirs. I know what you mean. It has this beautiful futuristic, shiny metallic vibe to it that only *Strung Out* could pull off. Crazy that it's 20 years old. They were my go to favorite band for a really long time.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/252/2a96cbd8b46e442fc41c2b86b821562f.png)  

> Authority Zero is a punk rock band from Mesa, Arizona . Authority Zero was started in 1994. The band has punk rock and reggae influences, with Bad Religion, Pennywise, and Sublime as heavy influences for the band. There is also an obvious Spanish/Portuguese influence in the band's music. 

> The band's latest album, entitled The Tipping Point was released on April 2nd 2013. The band toured with Rehab on the ""Lack of Luxury"" 2007 tour. This album is the final one featuring Jeremy Wood on bass, leaving in November 2006 due to personal differences within the band.

> Lead singer Jason DeVore has also released material as a solo artist.

> Authority Zero was started in 1994 when Bill Marcks met Jason DeVore at Westwood High School. Marcks didn't actually meet DeVore until the summer of 1995, until then Authority Zero consisted of two guitarists (Marcks & Jerry Douglas) and a drummer J.W. Gordon, all from Westwood. This trio put a few songs together without lyrics or basslines. When that summer rolled around, Douglas was expecting the yearly visit of his friend Jason DeVore, from Wyoming. Douglas introduced his long time friend and Marcks jokingly asked if he wanted to be their singer, soon later it was no joke.

> Marcks was impressed with DeVore's ability to ""write catchy songs in fifteen minutes with really sticky hooks"". The two quickly enlisted Jeremy Wood on bass. His experience with lead guitar and musical theory separated his bass playing from others'. Not just a ""follow along,"" his baselines were independent and yet fluid with the music. (Wood actually taught Marcks & Douglas how to play guitar). However, because of Gordon's commitment to the Air Force, his position as drummer soon had to be replaced. Fellow classmate, skateboarder, and drummer Daniel Garcia fit this empty stool like a missing puzzle piece. He brought a new charge and tempo that evolved Authority Zero's music into a faster, more complex, punk rock style. Eventually, however, differences and family obligations led to Garcia's exit from the group.

> Marcks, Douglas, DeVore, and Wood finally came upon Los Angeles native Jim Wilcox formerly of Welter/The New Militia who's tragic events ended the group, and he fittingly completed the Authority Zero's lineup. Later Douglas also left the group and joined the Air Force.

> After releasing a local EP that sold very well, Authority Zero released their debut album A Passage In Time in 2002 on Lava Records. The album featured a blend of genres including punk rock and reggae, with obvious Spanish and Portuguese influences. A Passage In Time included the hits ""One More Minute"" and ""Over Seasons"".

> The success of A Passage In Time propelled the band into new popularity. Authority Zero appeared on many tours, such as Warped Tour, the No Use for a Name/The Starting Line tour, and Sum 41's ""Sum on Your Face"". The band has also toured with the likes of Everclear, Guttermouth and H2O.

> In 2004, Authority Zero released Andiamó, again on Lava Records. ""Andiamó"" means literally ""We go"" in Italian, but can also be read as ""And I am Zero"", the title of their live DVD released following Andiamó. The album again featured a blend of genres and Spanish/Portuguese influences. Andiamó is somewhat politically charged, evident in the songs ""Revolution"", ""A Thousand Years of War"", and the cover of the song ""Mexican Radio"", originally written by Wall of Voodoo (the version that appears on Andiamó has lyric changes in order to make a statement against the 2003 invasion of Iraq). In the summer of 2006, Authority Zero released a live acoustic compilation album titled Rhythm and Booze on Suburban Noize Records.

> The band's next album, entitled 12:34 was released on January 30, 2007. The track ""Courage"" was released as a single. The band recently toured with Rehab on the ""Lack of Luxury"" 2007 tour. This album is the final one featuring Jeremy Wood on bass, who left Authority Zero in November 2006 due to personal differences within the band.

> On December 30th, 2008 Bill Marcks posted a blog on his MySpace stating he left the band to spend more time with his family and to focus 100 percent on his new band, Sanziggo.

> Jason DeVore has also been working on a side project called The Bollox, an Irish punk band he started with longtime friends.

> It has also been confirmed that Authority Zero is working on a new studio album to be released February of 2010.

> Dean ""DJ"" Farmer resigned as the bass player on July 20, 2009 citing personal, business, and creative differences.

> Jeremy Wood has rejoined Authority Zero as the bass player.

I also enjoy that they had to write this song because the stupid fascists didn't grasp the irony of FFFRV lyrics and the DK had to actually write a plain language song so they would understand that they were completely against everything the skinheads stood for"

1601853337.0|Music|mangarooboo|There are fewer trains this time around, but they've always been grabby little bitches.
1601853334.0|Music|caligari87|"Honestly it wasn't typically meant to be ""enjoyed"" at least not in the conventional sense.

Punk back then was about rebellion, non-conformity, breaking down of power structures, etc. Often that included rejecting things like traditional musical structure and sounds. It's meant to be abrasive, rough, nasty, and hard to like. It's meant to shock, to make proper society gasp in horror at this monstrous affront to ""good taste"". Plus the fact that a lot of punk musicians didn't actually have much in the way of musical training or ability; a common trope was that ""all you need is three chords and the truth"".

Nowadays, ""punk"" as a genre has been mostly co-opted by commercial interests. Packaged and polished in a more accessible format, just edgy enough to be exciting but not so abrasive that it can't sell millions of albums with a catchy radio single. 

The counterculture, ironically, became the culture."

These ghouls have eroded democracy through donations, lobbying and joboffers to politiciand.

The new era of social capitalism MUST be one that seeks to abolish this separation of society into owners and producers. We, the producers, are the many, and if we all start seeing the oppression that this separation puts on us and join forces, they can never defeat us.

Idk I guess I just have an old spirit in me.


to be honest I’ll try not to be rude about it and just give my opinion, I just don’t find them too useful, and the symptoms I’ve seen of COVID just seem so similar to the Flu.

We don’t wear masks for the flu, why this, why didn’t we do this for Ebola or swine flu?

And sure, 200k people died, that is a lot, but the flu kills millions of people a year anyway, but that gets no recognition because it’s common.

Idk, I just don’t really think we should be so worried about corona because it’s just something, in my opinion, similar to the Flu, with very similar symptoms, maybe a few different but nothing life threatening.

Take it like this, my grandfather is 78, if he got the flu, he would have a small chance at dying, and it’s pretty much the exact same for corona, since someone on the Wall Street journal said that trump, who is in his 70’s, and is overweight, has a 4% chance of death, which isn’t that bad for how old he is and his health at the moment"

That's not to say having some patriotism is inherently bad, but nationalism generally leads to people covering their eyes and ears whenever their country is criticized.

Someone from his team will take over his twitter account and post updates about how great he's feeling. They'll take a bunch of photos and videos of him **now** with updates from the hospital that they will drip as he goes through intensive care but his ride around town will be the last live footage we will see of him for weeks if he gets worse.

My only question is, if this does happen and he dies, when will they give it up?"

1601864815.0|pics|Mrrasta1|Got a story for you. Boeing and paint. My uncle was a master painter at Boeing for years and years when his supervisor came to him with a number one priority job. He needed three cruise missiles for Monday to show off to some Washington big shots. Senators and Pentagon dudes. He said point blank it wasn’t possible. The super said whatever it takes, get it done. OK uncle gets three shifts a day organized and away they go. It’s Friday and they have two and a half days to get the missiles ready. The paint has to be perfect. A couple of millimeters thickness on one side or the other can affect performance, but everybody pulled together with their best effort. Monday rolls around and the cruise missiles are waiting to be launched for the big shots. The first one looks good but starts to roll pretty bad so they blow it up. Number two is picture perfect. Number three starts to corkscrew wildly right after launch and has to be destoyed. Everyone shakes hands, job well done blah blah, and they head back to Washington. No one said a thing about it to my uncle or his crew.

Then they spouted off a list of all these people who I haven’t spoken to in 10 years that I *need* to tell. 

My closest family is by marriage, not by blood.  They then offered ‘congratulations’ by just saying ‘well we hope for a healthy baby’.

1601864310.0|pics|wil318466|"I don't deny reality in the least bit, you simply don't understand how the world works and what is true or not.  It's blatantly obvious YOU are the one believing what you're told, not me.  I don't care what Trump says, I look at the actual data.  You think I blindly believe what any person in this world tells me without looking it up myself?  Only a fool does that. 

Firstly, you believe that all the data you are given is true by default, and that it can not possibly be incorrect or manipulated.  Secondly, you're talking in absolute numbers and not percentages, because the populations of the countries you are talking about are wildly different, which even a child would realize.  Thirdly, you are the one using the argument from authority, with your ""trust in the science"" bullshit, which is OBVIOUSLY wrong. 

Lets look at a few things logically here.  Why do you think deaths in the US were being reported in the begining then all of a sudden it was switched to infections?  Why did Sweden, which had no lockdown whatsoever, have a similar death/infection rate as countries that had total lockdowns?  Also, what is the actual survival rate of the virus, in each age category?

YOU are the one blindly believing what you're being told by people who have absolutely no clue what they are talking about.  YOU are the one who believes propaganda, who completely disregards people who disagree with you as being fanboys. 

I look at everything through a skeptical eye.  I don't believe a fucking thing unless Iook it up myself, and I've come to the conclusion that almost every story about this is completely backwards.

Believe what you want, it's your life.  But I think one day soon you'll realize that the stuff you believe in is absolutely wrong.

Have fun."

They are both part of what makes a person's identity -- nature and nurture combine to make us who we are. If someone has an awesome stepparent, they still may have information they want to find out from a biological parent such as health info, ethnicity, family history etc that a step parent simply can't provide them. Either way, the person that raises you and loves you will always be most important.

1601864147.0|pics|evangelion-unit-two|Sure we do. Pointing to the *even worse* things Trump does is just a very concise way of pointing out that the people criticizing Obama generally care more about partisanship than the issues they're actually criticizing. I would argue that the use of drone strikes overall isn't a terrible strategy. If you're committed to continuing to combat ISIS and not completely pulling out of the middle east (read: power vacuum), then you can either send in troops, convince regional powers to send in troops, or use drones. The first gets American soldiers killed, the second is politically complicated and probably not practical to make a reality, so why not go with drones?

Noun  

1. Commitment to traditional values and ideas with opposition to change or innovation.

2. The holding of political views that favor free enterprise, private ownership, and socially conservative ideas.

>Conservatism is merely against radical reform...its not regressivism. Building on the past more than starting from.scratch.

Conservatives will call the solution to any problem ""radical reform"" if it causes them to lose a single cent o or bear even the mildest inconvenience.

The simple fact of the matter is that the problems we face today have no solution in the past that birthed these problems.

He put his son in law on the job (who, if I recall, wasn’t elected to a god damn thing) who thought there should be no unified federal response, but rather every state for itself. especially because it was initially hitting the states that would provide him with no electoral votes.

Most of the GOP leadership on the national level did take it seriously in the beginning, especially considering they are in the vulnerable age group. The red states that locked down the way they did, they were trying to not destroy their economies, and the stimulus was bi partisan. 

The reason they want to ""liberate"" states, is because their economies have grinded to a halt and they're going to see worse results from the continuous lock downs. Also, PA's lock downs were recently ruled unconstitutional.

So, Trump isn't far right, nor has he pushed the party to the right. If he was far right he wouldn't have went with the bump stock ban, the stimulus package, or increase our deficit."

1601863548.0|pics|AutoModerator|"[Obviously all lives matter. No one said they didn't](https://i.imgur.com/UyCmhSx.png). However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

The GOP would have to nominate someone else, but with so little time to get their name on the ballot and so many votes already cast, it becuase almost impossible for Biden to lose. Trump's votes don't transfer to their new candidate. 

So Biden would basically win by default. With Trump dead the likelihood that his base would turn out for down ballot elections would probably go down I think. Resulting an incredibly large blue was across local, state and federal elections. 

But I don't fucking know, this is all uncharted waters. 2020 is a bitch."

>Trump on Wednesday revoked Section 3 of Executive Order 13732, which required the director of national intelligence or other official to obtain information on the number of U.S. strikes against terrorist targets outside active combat zones.

>That order, which was signed by President Obama July 1, 2016, also required assessments of combatant and non-combatant deaths from those strikes, as well as the release of an unclassified summary of that information by May 1 of each year.

Although,

>“Including a classified annex allows DoD to share information within the U.S. government, while limiting the ability of enemies to employ counter tactics and procedures to purposefully jeopardize civilian lives as a military tactic,” Tresch said.

Genetics are one of the leading determinants of a persons health/well-being (alongside our social bonds) and understanding pieces of ones genetic history is important for some people, regardless of our other important bonds.

I just meant to point out that being a Law Professor doesn't exclude you from making boneheaded decisions.

For example, the expansion of executive power under Bush should have been *immediately* rolled back under Obama. It's a major failure for someone who was intimately familiar with constitutional law, how important it is to the balance of powers, and how it could be abused in the wrong hands. Given that, one can assume he made a calculated decision to ignore the constitutional issues so that he could benefit from the same expanded powers."

1601862989.0|pics|The_Beagle|"Bro stop and think about the things you say. You made a fucking comparison stating that people are unjust in their comparisons between Trump and Obama, regarding drone strikes, because Trump has had more. 

I postulated that the real issue isn’t that either president used drone strikes, rather the fact that Obama was awarded a Nobel peace prize while maintaining a high degree of drone strikes. Now I hate to be degrading but it is *very* clear that you struggle to connect concepts so I will reiterate: for the *first* time in this thread I associated the fact that Obama won a Nobel peace prize while having a very high amount of drone strikes as being the main reason people took note of his apparent lack of peaceful activity, RATHER than the number itself AND (in case you didn’t know) Trump has NOT received a Nobel Peace Prize and so less scrutiny has been given to his number of drone strikes BECAUSE it was the hypocrisy of giving a peace prize to a president who bombed the Middle East flat that caught people’s attention, not the fact that he took action allowed to his office. 

I hope this helps because it can’t be worded any more clearly, I feel like the potato in my kitchen could grasp this concept, by this point -.-‘ have a nice night and great life, I hope you find a good way to enhance your cognitive abilities and critical thinking skills over the course of your life."

That's not the part that's supposed to be funny. I take it that the humour here is supposed to derive from, for example, (a) the absurdity of the idea of getting a tattoo of all the funny scenes from the long-running sitcom; (b) the subverted expectations since the photo shows there is no tattoo at all; and (c) the silliness of uploading a photo of cling film wrapped around one's arm.

your saying Vice isnt racist simply because he left?   ignoring the fact that he founded it in 1994 but left in 2008..

are you saying that if he leave the proud boys, the proud boys are no longer racist?

1601863604.0|science|Neolife|"Our approach would be an IM injection, though there are also approaches with an inhaled delivery, to coat the lungs with the nanobody and attack the virus prior to infection.

Monoclonal antibodies and nanobodies are actually quite similar to one another. While typical antibodies have a larger antibody-binding region and a constant region, nanobodies in their simplest form have just a small antibody-binding region and no constant region. There are also constructs that conjugate the antibody-binding region of the nanobody to the constant region from human or other mammalian antibodies, called Nb-hcAbs (for nanobody - heavy-chain antibodies), which act very similar to classical antibodies but can be more potent.

So to sum that up, I don't know of any active nanobody treatments for autoimmune disease, but the similarities between those monoclonal antibody drugs and nanobody-based drugs can be incredibly high, to the extent where it would be highly probable that a nanobody-based drug would be able to replicate or improve upon the effects of a mAb for most conditions, at least that's what I would theorize based on my experience."

1601863459.0|science|Wormsblink|"Pharma scientist here, although I do purification work instead of antibody design.

Antibodies are like legos, they can be built in many combinations to “fit” the target biological substance. Binding critical proteins on the virus (like the spike protein it uses to enter cells) can “block” and disable it.

Nanobodies are like minimalist antibodies, they only contain the portion that binds. This is very useful since they will have a much smaller molecule which is more stable, causes less immune response and are excreted faster from the body. Also they can be produced in bacteria instead of mammal cells, which makes it far easier.

For the work in this paper (which I unfortunately can’t access), I believe they use phage display instead of an actual alpaca. Basically a huge amount of bacteriophages (viruses) are synthesized, then tested on the target protein. The protein coat around the virus allows it to possibly bind to the target protein if you’re lucky, but with millions - billions of different phases you’re likely to get a few hits. The bacteriophage with the best binding ability is identified, then sequenced to get the amino acid sequence.

The sequence can be used to construct antibodies, which the researchers can choose to use standard antibodies or in this case a nanobody from an alpaca. They just need to change the “lego” pieces on the antibody to the sequence they got from phage display.

So theoretically, it should be possible to build the antibody / nanobody from any mammal, including mice and humans. It just happens that nanobodies are useful so they went with camelids, specifically alpacas."

From that they took the active antigen-blocking part of the heavy chain and cut off the rest to make an even smaller nanobody protein. They've been investigated for cancer research because the smaller nanobodies not only fit into more places, but they also can be easier to make since you only need 1 genetic sequence to make a fully functional nanobody.

As to why evolution has maintained the 4 chain version, it's because it increases the amount of variability possible. All proteins up to tertiary structure are single strings folded onto themselves, so having an entire separate protein join up(quaternary structure) to make a functional antibody allows for addition complexity without compromising stability, like making origami from 2 pieces of paper instead of 1."

1601854474.0|science|MeanEYE|"While I don't have medical degree, I can talk about RF penetration in regards to WIFI as I worked for some years on establishing few ISPs here that were solely based on long distance WIFI.

Basically, penetrating power of 2.4GHz is not that big and loses energy very fast. In our usage case we had couple of watts of emitting power with a very directional antenna and smaller tree would reduce reduce signal by a huge amount, almost 2/3 of it. Not very scientific but hear me out. So we used anywhere from 2W to 5W power to emit long distances. Common house-hold WIFI routers are usually around 100 or 150mW. Orders of magnitude lower power and therefore very bad penetration. Apply inverse square law and your power drops significantly at even one meter. Not to mention antennas on WIFI routers are omnidirectional antennas covering 360°.

All that said, the higher you go in frequency lower the penetration power. At 5.8GHz penetration is significantly lower. Think about this in [sine waves](https://www.wifi-professionals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wave-length.png). In case of 5.8GHz signal has to travel longer though obstacle of same thickness.

---

So, inverse square law which is `i = 1 / r²`. If 360° antenna has 100mW at source, some 36° which are pointing at you would have 10mW. That's at source (let's say 1cm). At one meter distance it would have been much much much lower than what they tested for, it would have been around 0.0001mW. For comparison, signal strength devices around your home are receiving are anywhere between -50dBm and -100dBm, or in mW 0.00001 and 0.0000000001 respectively. Very very very low as you can see."

I bet I would be getting a superior product for less money if I was, especially when you consider the horrible practices their monopoly has created, but this is beside the point.

All you are doing is distracting from the main point, which is capitalism has selected the already wealthy and powerful in a time of crisis, in favor of the majority of people.  And I will double down in saying yes, the continued process of selling more consumer goods at the expense of the nationals health is sickening.  That is totally exclusive from yes, I understand we all need to do things to pass the time and keep us sane, I certainly have and I would expect anyone to do the same, but it doesn't mean we need to put the nation at risk to continue the process.

Having different interpretations doesn't erase all the violent and oppressive thing in the quran. There is no ""modern"" interpretation of verse 4:34 for example. There is a clear issue with the religion itself.

>From my vantage point and from what the statistics tell me, Islamophobia is a bigger issue than Islam itself 

The statistics not only do not say this, but they say the opposite to such a degree that it's comical.

>Or maybe you are into conservative politics in your country, and that's coloring your perceptions. 

You need to understand in one way or another that it's not politics, it's not the media, it's not stereotypes, it's not culture, and it's not people, islam is the problem. By islam, I mean the religion itself, the quran and hadiths, they are the problem. Just because you have no idea what they say that doesn't mean that I have a ""colored perception"".

> Regardless, the hysterical hostility is Islamophobic. 

This is another thing that you need to understand. There is no such thing as islamophobia. No matter how many times you say otherwise, there will never, ever be such a thing as a phobia of a religion, ever. This terms exists by extremist muslims for extremists muslims to shut down any criticism of this vile religion. Unfortunately for them and anyone who pushes for this ridiculous term, islam is not going to get a pass for blasphmey. It will get rightfully criticized.

> Islam is not any more dangerous than any other religion 

Again with fallacy, it's like you have nothing else to say. ""B... but what about other religions"" doesn't negate, justify, or excuse the shit that happens in islam. It's just whataboutism.

> People are religious because they have death anxiety and want something  to make their struggles easier. That is the primary function of  religion, not whatever else you have attached to it 

It's not me or anyone, you're the one who has this narrow ignorant view of what religion is. You don't understand it. Let me give you an example, in your view islam is some sort of harmless religion, well according to the scriptures themselves, you shouldn't exist.

B) False for the vast majority of companies except for like, the few whales people always talk about as if they represent the entire economy and all the employees.

Sure, the UN made up of nation states concerned with territorial integrity will usually support that doctrine. But what’s the right to self determination worth to you? The people living there have never wanted Azeri rule, not before nor after the USSR.

At the very least, the absolute minimum, they're only going to be taking a deal that allows them to stay in power.  

And any smart wielding of soft power will allow the larger benevolent ""donor"" nation to have a longstanding positive relationship with the nation they're getting involved with and giving the deal to.  That will typically involve, at least, making the current leadership of the smaller benefiting nation  happy.  And their happiness is generally bought and paid for in some real and tangible way.

When you go out for coffee, for example, you scan a government-supplied QR code which is displayed on the door of the business with the government's Covid-19 tracer app. The information is held on your phone, and then provided to the Ministry of Health contact tracer team if you ever need to be contacted.

Essentially the app and QR codes serve as a diary record of the places you visit, so that if in a week's time you are urgently called by the Ministry regarding a potential close contact with a Covid-19 positive case, you can give them precise details about the time and places you visited.

For those without devices able to scan QR codes, businesses must provide some alternative - normally this done by them asking you to sign in upon arrival, which takes longer, but earlier this month it was reported that more than 2.1 million people had downloaded the app."

Scientists generally agree we are living in the most critical time in human history, because humans have developed vast inequality and the capacity to destroy the planet through nuclear war and setting up unstoppable catastrophic climate change (see California).

We have a ways to go to get to the peace and harmony stage, and may not make it.  The so-called Aquarian Age symbolizes the possibility of a change, or mutation, in human consciousness, but the only pathway is through the dissolution (Aquarius) and destruction of obsolete structures, in society, religion/mythology and individual awareness.

We should note that we are leaving the Age of Pisces, which symbolizes male perfection (Jesus and all our gods and prophets) and moving into the age of perfected femininty (Mary Magdalene and #MeToo) and all the reckonings against male authority and domination.

We must learn to take care of our planet and co-species.  This is a feminine job though the guys could help a lot.  There's a lot at stake."

I think this confusion stems in part from the fact that for the average member, whether in America, Europe or elsewhere church affiliation is more a question of identity rather than any particular faith or reasoned argument. So you have all these individual but unspoken heterodoxies springing up from a deep-seated difference in cultural values.

Of course, nominally the pope is supposed to speak for the whole church, but he's not doctrinally infallible at all times and many Americans are already so entrenched in their individual views that ""Not my pope"" becomes a tantalizing alternative."

USA interest is even more. Its not because of climate change or deforestation, it was always because of: 1. Good position for military bases; 2. Unprecedent economic exploration.

In Brazil, there's a long term discussion about international help being used as a precedent to crush it's sovereignty. And it's not a conspiracy theory. There are plenty of speeches coming from American, French and British leaders saying that amazon rainforest should be an international territory. I believe that's a necessary context to understand what happened.  

Bolsonaro is still a moron? Yes

He doesn't know how to handle internacional politics? Double yes 

But implying that throwing money over Brazil because we HAVE to solve a problem that is not an ""amazon rainforest problem"", but a ""global biomas"" problem, is, to be honest, quite disrespectful. It suggests that the whole responsability for solving climate change problem is on Brazil's shoulders.

However, at the same time, there is a growing body of work showing the detrimental effects of keeping kids out of school across the globe.

Starting in the mid-80s with the first big wave of leveraged buy-outs, maximal shareholder value became gospel for Wall St bc of Harvard Business School professors preaching that a company investing its profits in the company was inherently much less efficient than disgorging those profits to its shareholders as quickly as possible. The idea behind this was that any good company can just cheaply borrow money to make internal investments and as such holding cash reserves or investing it in human resources from sources of profit was a misuse of that profit that devalued each dollar. Why invest $1 of profits in HR today when all it will get you is $0.05 in profit by the end of the year (even though it may profit $10 in 2 years) when you could just get a cheap loan and hire management consultants to insulate yourself from accountability for internal investments being mismanaged. Once that doctrine became gospel and globalization could hit formerly Communist markets, we started seeing many huge companies become gradually hollowed out, from Dell to GM.

As to it being a ""bribe"", I view it quite differently. Given Brazil's less than ideal treatment of the rainforests comes from their focus on economic interests and many wealthy countries also abused their environment back when they were industrializing, I see it as the wealthy countries trying to make it fair that they are telling Brazil not to treat they environment as they once did for profit.

As to you having no idea what Biden actually proposed, it doesn't surprise me that others have chosen to down vote since it goes over this stuff immediately in the article. Instead you are going to call Biden's plan idiotic when you haven't even made the smallest attempts to actually know what it is.

Finally, again I ask what are we supposed to do if not economically incentivise Brazil to do the right thing? I don't think it's reasonable to use military force and while culture is referenced as a source of power, I don't think a diss track is going to convince Brazil to change their actions."

1601862409.0|worldnews|Ode_to_Apathy|"Well the first part is that the UK has fallen from *the* global power to one of the more powerful nations of Europe. That's a hard pill to swallow for a nation that has long been built on exceptionalism. Imagine how horribly the US would take it if they suddenly stopped being globally relevant and people considered Canada the real power on the continent. 

This level of exceptionalism is of course directly tied to nationalism and the two of course are not going to admit that the nation just isn't a global power anymore. Then you need a reason why they currently aren't a global power. Of course, nationalism means that you cannot blame anything about the nation itself for it, so you have to look outside. That's where the EU comes in.

Then you have the issue of momentum. It's great to tell your constituents that it's outside forces and not them that are to blame, and it is great to stoke their fervor, but what do you do when your actions that were mostly made to garner support start to culminate? You can't back down, that's out of the question, so you just hope the fervor isn't at the level where it'll show all your rhetoric to be the falsities they are."

They sing a song of protecting indigenous land, but that’s just a front. They have no interest in protecting the environment. The legislative is predominantly leans left. The left parties in Brazil are the personification of corruption. Since the end of military dictatorship, Brazil has had one president impeached and removed from office, one president that resigned to avoid impeachment, and a former president that was was convicted after he left office. To overcompensate the atrocities of the military dictatorship, Brazil has historically been a center left leaning country. However, extreme corruption has led Brazil to once again over compensate by electing a moron who refuses to accept science, right leaning asshat. Soccer and carnaval used to be Brazil’s figurative religions. Now politics has, like in the US, become a matter of faith too. People vote with their guts, not their heads, and their supported politician can do no wrong. For instance, the politician who broke ties with Bolsonaro after the military police scandal and who had a vital vote that helped impeach the former left wing president from the PT party, has been accused by Bolsonaro supporters of being a PT spy infiltrated into Bolsonaro’s cabinet in order to destroy Bolsonaro from within. It’s batshit crazy over there. More so than here in the US.

The real concern is often not online attacks and yes, these systems can prevent hundreds to millions of guesses needed to break in. But ultimately you need layered security, so that should include good passwords. My argument that this wouldn't have sufficient entropy still stands.

For example even in the case of WPA2 which was once reasonably secure my buddy is now cracking these with only a single sample to brute force. This wasn't intended possible in the protocol but eventually was.

This has other big impacts too like if a database with authentication information is leaked. People will grab the salted and or hashed passwords and user accounts and crack the hash, then start trying to authenticate with those credentials everywhere.

You acknowledge that this brute force hashing isn't applicable to a lot of systems with bottlenecks for auth attempts but still, a password being that insecure will have effects down the line if there's a protocol or implementation mistake. This is why you wouldn't want to use an eight digit PIN for accessing your bank, but that would be fundamentally safe if the login attempts are limited. Until of course it's not."

[Genomic testing and other investigation](https://www.newsroom.co.nz/the-nz-strains-our-second-wave) has identified that it is a different strain to the Covid being found during the first wave earlier in the year, and the best possible sources at this point in time are believed to be a breach at a quarantine border facility or imported surface of some kind. Testing in the community was certainly down during our 100+ day streak of zero community cases, however not enough that a completely different strain could develop and go unmissed.

[A frozen food importer, the earliest traced location of the second wave](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/300085243/coronavirus-americold-ruled-out-as-the-source-of-auckland-covid19-outbreak) has been ruled out after a thorough investigation.

It’s like tying a binary decision to a coin flip: when it is flying in the air, you sometimes know which way you want it to land; that instinct, more than where it actually lands, should guide your behavior.  When you hear “the stars mandate an age of peace and harmony beginning in a couple months,” how do you respond. Do you *want* an Age of Aquarius to begin around December 21? What actions would you have to take? What attitudes would you have to cultivate?

I’m a scientist, but one thing I resent about Rationalism is the now widespread idea that everything has a 1:1 explanation, and chains of cause and effect are fully comprehendable. Any religion or mythology (and Astrology has aspects of both) are more interesting when engaged with, even if just a little bit; belief is not actually required."

We have heroines in media like Wonder Woman, Black Widow, and Captain Marvel that are held up on a pedistal as though it's indicative of 'how far we've come'. I mention comic movies because thanks to their recent success, they're the only ones that seem to get enough time discussed as examples on this topic. The real test will be if the overall makeup of stories and how female characters are used in telling them will shift in ten, twenty, or fifty years and if the changes stuck. The most recent film in my memory that I can recall that fits the idea of women seen as heroic or flawed as any male character was Annihilation. Maybe the opinions of Tolkien will change on the next LOTR telling without the manufactured Arwen romance distracting from the other more interesting female roles, or hopefully we see some of Galadriel (and other women) during the Silmarillion when she was more Warrior Queen in her prime, than the introspective, philosophical ruler of a waning power in LOTR.

>countries are not afraid to bear higher costs, such as Trump's tariffs

Congrats, you just named the one economic policy that makes every economist in America afraid. If you talk to an economist, you'll notice that the word ""tariff"" is not a well-received one in their circles. The reason that China's exports were not affected is because they in fact changed very little and American consumers are the ones paying for it.

>It is not a given that China will export less

That's not the only thing that matters. China wants their stuff, and they want it cheap. If you restrict extraction of resources from the Amazon, one of those two will change. Simple economics.

>You should take responsibility for operationalizing your own variable

I did that on purpose. I brought up an issue, and I addressed it. If green tech wasn't better for future generations, there would not be countries out there desperate to curb it and scientists warning us to change our ways every two seconds."

In this vast universe what is right now and what has been on this planet is as close as we can get to understanding what lies beyond our own solar system. The odds were in our favor and and we adapted to what we were givin thus making us sentient as we are now. We have been around for a long enough time that something as trivial as defencelessnes  at birth isn't or shouldn't even be a question asked since we have surpassed this point in time a long time ago.

Largest transaction I have seen happened when I was travelling with my family, I was 15 at the time and I have always liked watches so I went into a fine watch store in the Schiphol airport, I believe it could’ve been a Rolex store, but I think there were other brands as well. I saw a man casually buying 3 watches all together worth 42000€. He bought them like I buy a soda in the store, just casually entered his PIN and moved on. I just couldn’t believe my eyes since that was an amount of money that most people in my country will never have randomly laying around."

I also have the right to scream nonsensical garbage at people walking by on the street, but it doesn't mean it's not disrespectful. 

Whatever agreements you have made with others are where the cheating comes in. Are you sharing something of yourself that you promised to only share with that one person. 

Now we're into the semantics of owning someone's sexual activity. ""Only I can have sex with my SO because they are mine."" It's a very standard concept. What it should be is ""Only I can have sex with my SO because that is what they promised to me."" As there is no ownership, just agreement. 

If the thing you are doing is outside the agreements you have made, then it is cheating. If the things you are doing are not disclosed, then there can be no agreement, so that it's deceit by omission. If the SO knows but doesn't like it, then it is their decision to continue or not, but the agreement is intact as everything is disclosed. If the SO knows and doesn't mind, then all good all round."

I hate that I made them afraid of me, their caretaker, and it always pulls me out and pushes me to calm them down and care for them and be nice, and while I’m doing that, the anger immediately fades and the depression is lessened. The more I put into caring for them and interacting with them, the less focused I am on my depression. 

tl;dr: actively caring for my pets helps take the focus off of me and puts it into them; sort of an exercise in mindfulness. More effective than DBT if you ask me"

Yeah, I honestly didn't know what to believe about Johnny's innocence in the matter at the beginning either, but it's like a significant part of myself clearly stood up for him without any proof and serious knowledge of the events that led him to that situation. May have been hypocrite when stating that it was obvious he wouldn't resort to violence, but I'm pretty sure of it anyway. Do you happen to know what's the conclusion of the case?

First of all, only your first description is a genius.  Someone who accomplishes things through hard work and dedication could be a genius, or they might not be.  You’re describing conscientiousness, not intelligence.  Genius is high intelligence, nothing more or less.

Let’s stop using terms like genius for the finer part of this argument.  Genius typically is accepted to be 160 IQ.  This means you 4 standard deviations from the mean IQ.  3 standard deviations would make you smarter than 99.7% of people.  I’m not sure the exact math for 4 SDV, but it’s effectively 99.999%.  Putting you at one in 10,000.  Researchers who look at gifted children actually put true “genius” level IQ even higher to define that kid who graduates high school around age 13 and is capable of undergraduate level learning in his/her early teens.  They represent this individual as closer to 1 in 1 million.  

Anyway,  why am I talking about this?  Well everyone can’t do what that 1 in 1 million kid can do.  Everyone also can’t do what everyone who is a member of the Mensa or whatever it’s called genius registry at IQ 160.  It does not matter how much hard work you put in,  they will be able to accomplish things you do not have the ability to accomplish, period.  However these people are extremely rare.  Of them, many won’t reach their full potential anyway.  IQ is actually a rather crappy predictor of success after a certain point. 

Now let’s talk about more relevant levels of IQ.  Average IQ is 100.  68% of people fall between 85 and 115.  Somewhere between about 115 and 125, IQ stops predicting success.  

Let’s talk medical school because that is a widely known level of high academic achievement.  A person with an IQ of 115 can go to medical school and likely do fine. However, someone with an IQ of 100 is very unlikely to make it to this level of advanced education, and is very unlikely to do well.  Someone with an IQ of 85 would be very unlikely to complete an undergraduate curriculum in a hard science to even be eligible to apply to medical school.

Let’s go back to your argument now.  When we talk about that 115 individual, if they apply themself it is likely they can accomplish most things.  The only things that they might do well in would be extremely high level math and physics that require even higher IQ.  However it’s very unlikely they’d want to do that anyway.  Most other people are fairly limited by their Innate ability."
1601865801.0|AskReddit|daggerxdarling|"Thank you very much! Please do, I'm so glad you're able to. It always brings me joy to hear someone speak so lovingly of their children. I'm certain you're a fantastic parent.

Really? How does one go about helping with that? I wouldn't mind offering my story for that! It's not an easy job, the chance to help even a little and show their work will be appreciated no matter what sounds very fulfilling! I'd had a number of miscarriages before her, so that may help them understand a situation slightly more complicated in the grief department (if that makes any sense, all grief is valid and complicated). Come to think of it, that's probably why i was so adamant about getting the ""punchline"" asap. It was always an immediate answer prior - before i could even ask a question. The uncertainty was entirely new, especially for the one who finally ""made it,"" so to speak.

I love those guys, I started watching Fresh first, followed by Cue back in 2018. I was subbed to them when they made their 100 subscriber specials.

Next came AnotherXYZ and Ailiarus, about a month later. Wonderstruck came across my feed early 2019, about the same time I discovered GioFilms.

OneTopic is an extremely wholesome guy, I found him during this spring(2020), and he is good friends with TheClick, who I also subscribed to.

Many people have terrible presentation, not the best(if any) voice acting, and mill posts like crazy. Sorrow is taking a break right now, which makes me sad; but he'll be back and his videos are hysterical.

These guys have consistent upload schedules without being over the top. Gio, One Topic and TheClick have nearly everyday or everyday uploads. Wonderstruck does one a week I think? AnotherXYZ, Cue, Ailiarus, and Fresh have schedules that are seemingly random; however they put out decent length videos, that are high quality.

Fresh has to be my all time favorite. Not only for being the first Reddit reader I found, but because the quality of his videos are amazing. You can tell he puts hours into them, his sarcasm is unmatched and I love throwing on his videos even after the 10th time watching them."

There was suppose to be an option to opt out and parents could refuse the flouride treatments but we were forced by the teachers to take the tablets even if our parents didnt sign the waivers giving permission. Wed get recess or lunch taken away and some of the teachers would shove the tablets in our mouths by force. 

A lot of parents were really pissed about it but nothing really changed and we were all just sorta forced to take the fluoride. I have permenant white spots/streaks on all of my teeth as a result of it.

Each teacher had a big pill bottled full of small white unmarked fluoride tablets and would walk around the room every morning giving the tablets. 

That principal was ""forcefully retired"" when i was in 6th grade due to child abuse claims. We left the school after that so I don't know if the fluoride thing continued with the new principle or not."

I was truly happier single, some people are just built that way and I may be one of them. My kids are grown because I had them when I was young and was married and divorced young so I was having a great time traveling with my adult kids and focusing on my career and fell for the old “you need to settle down” crap. Nope you don’t need to settle or settle down if that isn’t what makes you happy.

When I went to the hospital last, I had 36 vials of blood drawn (that was a fun chart for them to fill out, then they called the lab and said ""these test saren't on your sheet, I want those too""), followed by a CT scan, and later an ultrasound.  Turned out I had 3 bigass pulmonary embolisms, which explained why I felt like I was half dead.  That was free - just walk out and say thanks.

Canada's health care system is backed way the fuck up... there are systemic reasons for it.  To name a few, underpayed doctors (kind of like sports teams, why the fuck would you play for a Canadian team when an American team will pay you twice as much), understaffed facilities, and the one you're going for... too many people using the system.

On one hand, if you need it, you should use it.  On the other, when people are going to the emergency room for a fever (literally, every time I can remember being there I've heard the doctor explaining to someone their non-emergency condition).

They use it, because the GPs are all busy and not taking new patients.

Do I like the system?  No.  But about the only thing I'd do is add a co-pay for *electives* and non-emergency (at hospitals) to dissuade abuse of the system."

1601865680.0|AskReddit|bigthama|"No it is not. That's not even close to being the definition of homeopathy.

Homeopathy at its core is the belief that ""like cures like"" as claimed by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century. This was in contrast to allopathy, the idea that effective treatments for disease would likely not be made from the same type of thing as the disease itself. 

Homeopaths believe that by diluting a substance you make it more powerful. Thus, to treat arsenic poisoning, an extremely dilute arsenic solution might be used. The number of dilutions used by modern homeopaths result in solutions where it is statistically improbable for even a single molecule of the treatment to remain. The homeopathic response to this is that ""water has memory"" and retains therapeutic properties of substances even after they are no longer in solution. The implications of this for sewage treatment aside, this means that homeopathic remedies are implausible with respect to basic laws of physics, chemistry, and biology.

Unless this person was receiving 6C dilutions of spiderwebs, then their treatment was not homeopathic. 

Natural remedies are not necessarily homeopathic, and homeopathic remedies are not necessarily natural. Traditional remedies predate homeopathy by millenia, such as traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine. Mainstream, science-based medicine makes use of natural remedies and medicines based on natural remedies all the time. I regularly prescribe aspirin, which is derived from a traditional bark remedy. Penicillin is a natural remedy derived from mold. The only thing that makes these natural, traditional remedies part of mainstream medicine is that science has proven their effectiveness."

If you want an anime that has concluded, Fullmetal Alchemist should be in your top choices. And AOT is ending soon, it's an amazing anime.

My Hero Academia was pretty much my first anime (Except Bakugan lol) but it's nowhere near wrapping up and the fanbase is...bad. But the plot is easy to understand and it's overall an amazing anime, it's just absurdly overhyped."

1601865522.0|AskReddit|404__LostAngeles|"Do you honestly believe the only thing you need to worry about is whether your skin is moisturized or not? Like what if people have acne and want to treat it? Should they do nothing? I'm honestly confused about your beliefs. Are you just anti-corporate and believe all the research done on skincare products is fake and they're just trying to sell us stuff? Or do you think humans should live as naturally as possible, without the aid of any products? I'm genuinely curious.

Also, I never said signs of aging are unnatural or unsightly. Obviously as we age our skin will show signs of it, but there's nothing wrong with trying to slow this process. You act like caring about your appearance is somehow a bad thing. Taking care of my skin is just another part of my daily hygiene routine, same as taking a shower and brushing my teeth. Also, it's a fact that UV rays cause damage to your skin and increase your risk of cancer, so to say that you don't require sunscreen is **you** not facing reality. I'm not sure why your response is so hostile, I was never trying to push anything on you, just making a suggestion. Do you also not shampoo or use soap? I mean, those aren't exactly ""natural,"" but they sure do help with keeping clean."

1601865908.0|aww|Kalooeh|"I had a Skookum, which is a Munchkin and a La Perm mix. Guy lived to be 18 years. Biggest health problem was he couldn't have cat food with grain in it and that's not even an uncommon problem with cats in general. Really he had no mobility issues and he even one managed to rebound off the couch and right over my head onto a chair, then take off through the house during a zoomies. Often up in one of the cat trees, on the back off the couch, of jumping up onto places with the other cats. 

Outweighed all the other cats too and Rocko was solid as hell with all the muscle to him. With his size, and short front legs and long hair he actually looked somewhat like a raccoon because just this stocky weird shaped cat. Didn't growl either, just made a huffing noise at the other cats (like hffhffhffhfffhff)

No problems with his back or legs. I had a regular cat that's back kind of sank as she aged but her AND her brother also ended up with sinus and mouth/throat cancer, along with other health problems. 

The thing is that Munchkins have been confirmed to not have specific health problems that aren't really breed specific since other breeds can have health conditions show up like with their backs, but people keep clinging to the old shit from people like Peta and the Dodo that because they have this look that they must be unhealthy.

The biggest problem for the breed really is the gene for it is dominant and can't breed two short-dominants together.

1601865895.0|aww|RiposteHatesYou|"Dachshunds have an extended back though, corgis do not. The issue comes from increased impact from the short legs, but has nothing to do with their actual spine. However, as long as you take care of your corgis and don't let them jump from high places, they are fine. I've got 2 of them. 

I agree that breeds that have horrible health problems right from the get go, like bulldogs can barely breathe right from birth. I think ""tea cup"" versions are the worst though, and are normally straight from inbreeding. Anyone who buys a tea cup Chihuahua is an asshole as far as I'm concerned."

And then, you feel more than one pair of eyes on you. Slightly nervously, you turn your gaze to my back seat. There, sits the entirety of Santa's sled team. You don't get a chance to say anything before I utter, ""Ho, ho, ho."" And drive the car off the road into a tree."

1601865753.0|funny|DankMemes148|"Disclaimer: not a medical professional.

They use local anesthesia no matter what to ensure that the patient doesn’t feel pain, but dentist also might use IV sedation for wisdom teeth (drugs that make the patient really loopy and unable to remember most of the removal, but not completely unconscious) to make sure that the patient is comfortable during the removal so that the oral surgeon can do what they need to.  Even if the patient is unable to feel pain while getting their wisdom teeth removed because of local anesthesia, the process of the wisdom teeth being crushed and yanked out will probably still feel pretty uncomfortable, and could terrify the patient.  IV sedation should allow the patient to remain calm through the course of the removal to let the oral surgeon do their work.  Whether or not IV sedation should be used would also probably depend on the severity of the wisdom teeth removal: some people need 2 removed, some all 4, some people’s wisdom teeth are really stuck and need to be yanked out extremely forcefully, others are easier to get out.   

So while IV sedation isn’t required (in most cases at least) and the patient doesn’t have to use it if they absolutely don’t want to, you could see why a lot of oral surgeons would recommend some form of IV sedation to be used along with local anesthesia during the procedure."

1601865659.0|funny|LilacSlumber|"My cat did this.  He was found with his brothers in the woods in July 2019.  My friend took the kittens and mother to her house and I got him when he was 6 weeks or a couple more.

We have another cat and I think he has mostly grown out if it after watching her.  I haven't seen him sit that way for a few months now.  He did it for almost a year.

He was also mildly cross-eyed, but it has corrected itself since he's been with us.

I really think having the roll model of our other cat has helped him figure out a lot of things.  Does your cat have another cat buddy to watch and learn from?"

1601865473.0|funny|maeelstrom|"I don't think some people commenting here get it.  First off, this is a really old comic and if you don't know it well, you don't know this is typical of Calvin's Dad and is part of the humor of the strip.  It's actually a very fun, funny, hilarious strip about an awesome kid.

Secondly, if you're not well over 40 this won't make as much sense to you, in my opinion.  I'm 48 and (sometimes) I feel guilty for just being outside for no reason.  Take a walk down the road, or in the woods, have a smoke, look around, spend time with just me and myself.  It's awesome but I think a lot of cultures look down on adults for ""doing nothing"".  When actually you're doing one of the best things you can:  relaxing and recharging without sleeping!

But some of us have allowed ourselves to live so long going by societal expectations that you should always be busy ""doing"" something that yes, it's rough at first when you decide that is NOT the way you have to live.  Guilt can be a very hard habit to break."

RDR2 was on Game Pass for 4 months, so that's like $40-$60 if you just wanted to play that game, and you don't even get to keep it!

Of course, the Game Pass library is big, so there's a variety of games to play, but, honestly, I don't even have time for all the games on Stadia at the moment.

It's a drive-in chain throughout the United States, and I think Canada. A drive-in is different from a drive-through in that you park in a spot and the food is brought out to your car instead of you pulling up to a window. You order over an intercom you initiate with a red button.

They used to wear roller skates, but they don't anymore.

They sell products in these categories: burgers, chicken, hot dog, ice cream, drink fountain, custom drinks, milkshakes, bagged ice, and gallon tea. They also default to take tots instead of french fries, and their tots are better than their fries. They also have onion rings.

Their commercials are stupid, typically with two guys in a parking spot waiting on their food and saying moronic things. [here you go.](https://youtu.be/yV7B3XyrfGs)

Groening told Entertainment Weekly, ""It’d be a shame if we all went our separate ways [after this season]. We would love to continue. We have many more stories to tell.

I still stand by what I said about disagreement. I think a discussion can be had with anyone even if there is a disagreement because it gives you insight into how the other person thinks. And that is infinitely better than 'agreeing to disagree' or anything else, imo. 

I was in your spot a few years back when the pronoun debacle was in the limelight. My mum's an English teacher and so grammar was knocked into my head from an early age. And my native language has a similar situation to English with no gender neutral pronouns. 

I hope my comments help you understand why people seem to refuse to budge on the usage of 'they' and I do hope I didn't seem patronising or sanctimonious in my comments. I was only trying to say what I've heard from people and friends who are NB or trans and my own opinions. I hope you have a lovely rest of the day/night. Stay safe!"

1601865947.0|pics|Harambe-2036|">""Funny, but it is not a fucking pic."" - keynote0

keynote0 is claiming that while the image is funny it does not belong on this subreddit because it's not a picture (""pic"" is short for the word ""picture"").

>""Um, yes it is?"" - Rivent

Rivent is claiming that it is a picture. Further implication is that it does belong on this subreddit.

>""It's an image not a picture."" - Me

I am making the argument that ""picture"" in the context of this subreddit is something that has been taken by a camera and is largely unedited. This is a photoshopped joke/image and not really appropriate for this subreddit. It belongs in /r/funny or /r/politicalhumor. Furthermore, I would argue that this violates at least the spirit of Rule 1B, even though there is no text. 

/u/PFnewguy...is this slow enough for you?"

1601865945.0|pics|Atomhed|"The literal definition of conservatism:  

Noun 

1. Commitment to traditional values and ideas with opposition to change or innovation.  

2. The holding of political views that favor free enterprise, private ownership, and socially conservative ideas.  

>Conservatives merely dont believe in tearing down the past and institutions.

You can't tear down the past, it's the past, it's being replaced with the future whether conservatives like it or not - and any institution that causes problems in society should be replaced as well, there is no reason to ""believe"" in institutions that don't serve the people who fund them."

Considering Vice has never been a right-wing rag, I think its safe to say the other founders were not similar to Mcinnes.  If Hitler had founded a mag with 2 other people and nary a word about the Jews being the death of Germany, its safe to say Hitler was irrelevant in editorial content.  You're trying to argue that the principle founder and leader of a political activist group who recruits his own members is immaterial to the group's actions, statements, and presence in the political sphere.  I don't know how much more dense that can get.

The organizers, the proud boys members who have been initiated, carry the confederate flag.  Shit, the proud boys have more strict organization than BLM does, it isn't some rag tag right wing equivalent of Antifa.  They even have uniforms for fuck's sake.

Smell supposedly is the sense with the strongest memory. One time when I was on the UofM twin cities campus and had to use the bathroom I went to the basement of Kolthoff Hall to use that one. The soap in the dispenser was the same smell of the soap that I had in kindergarten. And that realization happened instantly. I don't remember a ton of things from childhood so this lightning strike was insane. That was the only bathroom that I ever found on campus that had that soap."

1601865292.0|pics|jlharper|"To anyone who is looking for a window into how these hate-based white supremacist groups manage to recruit new members, this is all you need to see. Notice the rebranding of 'hating others' as 'West is Best'. Rather than 'Right to incite hatred and commit assault on minorities' they say 'anti political correctness'. Notice how they want to put women back in the kitchen, but they frame it as 'venerating the housewife'.

Through careful marketing and manipulation of reality (literal fake news) they are able to hide their hate and bigotry behind a thin curtain of a 'pro male' agenda. They do not 'support men'. They ***do no***t donate to men's rights organizations or try to endorse pro-male legislation, or help to educate young men to help them achieve more in their life.

What they do is verbally, mentally and physically attack those who do not fit their narrow definition of the ideal man, which is a white, western male. That is because they are a hate group who is pro white male and anti everyone else.

It is likely this person is a member of the proud boys but distances himself from the group while sharing their recruitment message, portraying himself as a neutral third party rather than a recruiter to seem unbiased. It is an age old tactic. He will also be a racist, a white supremacist, a republican party conservative and a Trump supporter, but would potentially even deny all of the above when called out as such."

The current dynamic, where we have ghouls who earn their living a hundred times over, not by working, but by owning land, or buildings or even the equipment and patents that you need in order to do your job, is fundamentally broken.

These ghouls have eroded democracy through donations, lobbying and joboffers to politiciand.

The new era of social capitalism MUST be one that seeks to abolish this separation of society into owners and producers. We, the producers, are the many, and if we all start seeing the oppression that this separation puts on us and join forces, they can never defeat us.

>Finally, again I ask what are we supposed to do if not economically incentivise Brazil to do the right thing? I don't think it's reasonable to use military force and while culture is referenced as a source of power, I don't think a diss track is going to convince Brazil to change their actions.

What you hit on is much closer to my position which is there are definitely things capitalism does to benefit us, and I would even go so far as to say it's sort of intrinsic to life in general, it doesn't account for the fact it has to be modified in order to get better results.  If the economic model dictates throwing human lives at it to keep making money for cooperations, it isn't serving us well as a people.

There are always going to be bad actors with anything but the majority of people abide by conservation laws and help support the local economies. I've spent time in Africa and Asia in areas where conservation big game hunting happens, and every person I've met in those areas is a big supported due to profit for the local government.

It is not easy hunting, and any hunter will tell you that there is a mutual respect that is grown when tracking an animal. That sustinance you are gaining is far better than the horrors of factory farming or the death the animal will face in the wild.

People need to stop being ignorant to where food comes from, and the fact that we as humans are not above the food chain, we are a part of it. Few people bring a ""trophy"" home with I'll thoughts of what they have achieved. On the contrary, every hunter learns to respect the animal that gave its life for their sustinance and to use as much of the animal as possible in order to be respectful to the animal and not wasteful.

Again, there are bad actors in anything, but the thousands of good, respectable hunts that happen every year that you don't hear about, out-numbered the handful of bad ones you do hear hear about."

I clearly remember why Mao used the term Maxims given China's never been like Soviet Union since day one. Expert may correct me if I was wrong.

\+ Mao spent 10¬15 years investigating how the poorest people make a living in the country side & what made them so poor

\+ He thought if he can unify the poor people he would take over the country

\+ In the very beginning, Mao didn't agree with the maxim because at that time China had no industry.  There was no concept like production & productivity measurement. 

\+ Once a bloke told him that these poor people need some similarity in paper. Perhaps maxims could be useful because it talked about poor people in Europe as well. 

\+ It cost Mao months to make the final decision. He finally agreed but insisted that these words should just be the tool. In today's words, the PR tool or propaganda.

To my knowledge, China has never genuinely learnt from Soviet Union system."
