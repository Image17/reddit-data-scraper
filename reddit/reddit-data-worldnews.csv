1601865921.0|worldnews|ParkJiSung777|">Biden's intention to end up offering $20 billion to address keeping the Amazon safe is a very different scale and focus than what you are attempting to claim is the same move.

Different scale but money itself isn't going to make the current Brazilian administration agree with us.

>I see it as the wealthy countries trying to make it fair that they are telling Brazil not to treat they environment as they once did for profit.

Sure that's a fair interpretation as well but again, that's not going to change the effectiveness of his plan.

>As to you having no idea what Biden actually proposed, it doesn't surprise me that others have chosen to down vote since it goes over this stuff immediately in the article.

He's very vague, probably purposefully. What does ""countries of the world mean""? Does that mean large Brazilian trade partners like China? If so, how he's going to get them on board since they have no incentive. Asking these questions show that Biden's plan is almost illogical.

>Finally, again I ask what are we supposed to do if not economically incentivise Brazil to do the right thing? I don't think it's reasonable to use military force and while culture is referenced as a source of power, I don't think a diss track is going to convince Brazil to change their actions.

Diplomatic force from regional actors is what's important. Empowering relevant local actors in the Amazon is important. All of those don't require giving $20 billion and is probably more effective."

Actually it isn't.  If you have a question about a position you should ask and clarify it rather than assume and be incorrect.  That is the most basic step you could possibly take.  It isn't correct to assume that someone is rooting for some team just because you may be.

What you hit on is much closer to my position which is there are definitely things capitalism does to benefit us, and I would even go so far as to say it's sort of intrinsic to life in general, it doesn't account for the fact it has to be modified in order to get better results.  If the economic model dictates throwing human lives at it to keep making money for cooperations, it isn't serving us well as a people.

I've spent time in Africa and Asia in areas where conservation big game hunting happens, and every person I've met in those areas is a big supported due to profit for the local government.

It is not easy hunting, and any hunter will tell you that there is a mutual respect that is grown when tracking an animal. That sustinance you are gaining is far better than the horrors of factory farming or the death the animal will face in the wild.

People need to stop being ignorant to where food comes from, and the fact that we as humans are not above the food chain, we are a part of it. Few people bring a ""trophy"" home with I'll thoughts of what they have achieved. On the contrary, every hunter learns to respect the animal that gave its life for their sustinance and to use as much of the animal as possible in order to be respectful to the animal and not wasteful.

\+ Mao spent 10¬15 years investigating how the poorest people make a living in the country side & what made them so poor

\+ He thought if he can unify the poor people he would take over the country

\+ In the very beginning, Mao didn't agree with the maxim because at that time China had no industry.  There was no concept like production & productivity measurement. 

\+ Once a bloke told him that these poor people need some similarity in paper. Perhaps maxims could be useful because it talked about poor people in Europe as well. 

\+ It cost Mao months to make the final decision. He finally agreed but insisted that these words should just be the tool. In today's words, the PR tool or propaganda.

To my knowledge, China has never genuinely learnt from Soviet Union system."

And I mean solutions besides changing our ways of life to help counter act climate change. Yes, we should absolutely be doing that way more then we are but that change isn’t going to happen over night. In the mean time we need to be working on other solutions.

wrong again, and your reasoning that people wouldn't be able to communicate in such a way isn't because of capitalism, the way it's monetized and the winners of that game is the result of capitalism.  If you are asking my personal opinion on the matter, I would rather be paying the government for my net access than Spectrum.  I bet I would be getting a superior product for less money if I was, especially when you consider the horrible practices their monopoly has created, but this is beside the point.

All you are doing is distracting from the main point, which is capitalism has selected the already wealthy and powerful in a time of crisis, in favor of the majority of people.  And I will double down in saying yes, the continued process of selling more consumer goods at the expense of the nationals health is sickening.  That is totally exclusive from yes, I understand we all need to do things to pass the time and keep us sane, I certainly have and I would expect anyone to do the same, but it doesn't mean we need to put the nation at risk to continue the process.  Capitalism isn't telling you to pass the time with what you already have, it's still trying to get you to buy new stuff when collectively it's not the best for us right now."

Having different interpretations doesn't erase all the violent and oppressive thing in the quran. There is no ""modern"" interpretation of verse 4:34 for example. There is a clear issue with the religion itself.

>From my vantage point and from what the statistics tell me, Islamophobia is a bigger issue than Islam itself 

The statistics not only do not say this, but they say the opposite to such a degree that it's comical.

>Or maybe you are into conservative politics in your country, and that's coloring your perceptions. 

You need to understand in one way or another that it's not politics, it's not the media, it's not stereotypes, it's not culture, and it's not people, islam is the problem. By islam, I mean the religion itself, the quran and hadiths, they are the problem. Just because you have no idea what they say that doesn't mean that I have a ""colored perception"".

> Regardless, the hysterical hostility is Islamophobic. 

This is another thing that you need to understand. There is no such thing as islamophobia. No matter how many times you say otherwise, there will never, ever be such a thing as a phobia of a religion, ever. This terms exists by extremist muslims for extremists muslims to shut down any criticism of this vile religion. Unfortunately for them and anyone who pushes for this ridiculous term, islam is not going to get a pass for blasphmey. It will get rightfully criticized.

> Islam is not any more dangerous than any other religion 

Again with fallacy, it's like you have nothing else to say. ""B... but what about other religions"" doesn't negate, justify, or excuse the shit that happens in islam. It's just whataboutism.

> People are religious because they have death anxiety and want something  to make their struggles easier. That is the primary function of  religion, not whatever else you have attached to it 

It's not me or anyone, you're the one who has this narrow ignorant view of what religion is. You don't understand it. Let me give you an example, in your view islam is some sort of harmless religion, well according to the scriptures themselves, you shouldn't exist.

I don't fundamentally disagree. However, this disparity is

A) Rare. Find me a company with ""execs"" (multiple) taking home 8 figures each.

B) False for the vast majority of companies except for like, the few whales people always talk about as if they represent the entire economy and all the employees. In Apple's case your numbers are pretty much spot on (every employee could get \~500k if they distributed *all* profit equally). Most companies are nowhere near this. Do the math on a few. This kind of distribution amounts to jack shit for the vast, vast majority of companies from big to small.

If a nation is getting getting sweetheart deal for some act of partnership/collaboration of a grand scale... you can bet that the leaders are getting some sort reward for it, at least indirectly.  At the very least, the absolute minimum, they're only going to be taking a deal that allows them to stay in power.  

And any smart wielding of soft power will allow the larger benevolent ""donor"" nation to have a longstanding positive relationship with the nation they're getting involved with and giving the deal to.  That will typically involve, at least, making the current leadership of the smaller benefiting nation  happy.  And their happiness is generally bought and paid for in some real and tangible way. 

Also, for what it's worth, this is something that China is arguably doing much better than the United States.  Instead of starting large endless wars... they're making long term deals and setting up big business in many smaller less powerful nations."

Essentially the app and QR codes serve as a diary record of the places you visit, so that if in a week's time you are urgently called by the Ministry regarding a potential close contact with a Covid-19 positive case, you can give them precise details about the time and places you visited.

For those without devices able to scan QR codes, businesses must provide some alternative - normally this done by them asking you to sign in upon arrival, which takes longer, but earlier this month it was reported that more than 2.1 million people had downloaded the app."

Scientists generally agree we are living in the most critical time in human history, because humans have developed vast inequality and the capacity to destroy the planet through nuclear war and setting up unstoppable catastrophic climate change (see California).

We have a ways to go to get to the peace and harmony stage, and may not make it.  The so-called Aquarian Age symbolizes the possibility of a change, or mutation, in human consciousness, but the only pathway is through the dissolution (Aquarius) and destruction of obsolete structures, in society, religion/mythology and individual awareness.

We should note that we are leaving the Age of Pisces, which symbolizes male perfection (Jesus and all our gods and prophets) and moving into the age of perfected femininty (Mary Magdalene and #MeToo) and all the reckonings against male authority and domination.

We must learn to take care of our planet and co-species.  This is a feminine job though the guys could help a lot.  There's a lot at stake."

USA interest is even more. Its not because of climate change or deforestation, it was always because of: 1. Good position for military bases; 2. Unprecedent economic exploration.

In Brazil, there's a long term discussion about international help being used as a precedent to crush it's sovereignty. And it's not a conspiracy theory. There are plenty of speeches coming from American, French and British leaders saying that amazon rainforest should be an international territory. I believe that's a necessary context to understand what happened.  

Bolsonaro is still a moron? Yes

He doesn't know how to handle internacional politics? Double yes 

But implying that throwing money over Brazil because we HAVE to solve a problem that is not an ""amazon rainforest problem"", but a ""global biomas"" problem, is, to be honest, quite disrespectful. It suggests that the whole responsability for solving climate change problem is on Brazil's shoulders. 

And, well, it's not.

>The analysis backs up what scientists increasingly believe - that children, initially thought to be major potential spreaders of coronavirus infection, do not appear to be playing that role. However, at the same time, there is a growing body of work showing the detrimental effects of keeping kids out of school across the globe.   

This summarizes the report and is broadly consistent with the scientific consensus I have seen. The issue in the US is that covid is not broadly well controlled and hence the concern about schools."

Starting in the mid-80s with the first big wave of leveraged buy-outs, maximal shareholder value became gospel for Wall St bc of Harvard Business School professors preaching that a company investing its profits in the company was inherently much less efficient than disgorging those profits to its shareholders as quickly as possible. The idea behind this was that any good company can just cheaply borrow money to make internal investments and as such holding cash reserves or investing it in human resources from sources of profit was a misuse of that profit that devalued each dollar. Why invest $1 of profits in HR today when all it will get you is $0.05 in profit by the end of the year (even though it may profit $10 in 2 years) when you could just get a cheap loan and hire management consultants to insulate yourself from accountability for internal investments being mismanaged. Once that doctrine became gospel and globalization could hit formerly Communist markets, we started seeing many huge companies become gradually hollowed out, from Dell to GM.

1601862436.0|worldnews|mrpenchant|"While I can't explain why Bolsonaro rejected the offer from G7 of $20 million over a year ago to help deal with the fires they were addressing, Biden's intention to end up offering $20 billion to address keeping the Amazon safe is a very different scale and focus than what you are attempting to claim is the same move.

As to it being a ""bribe"", I view it quite differently. Given Brazil's less than ideal treatment of the rainforests comes from their focus on economic interests and many wealthy countries also abused their environment back when they were industrializing, I see it as the wealthy countries trying to make it fair that they are telling Brazil not to treat they environment as they once did for profit.

As to you having no idea what Biden actually proposed, it doesn't surprise me that others have chosen to down vote since it goes over this stuff immediately in the article. Instead you are going to call Biden's plan idiotic when you haven't even made the smallest attempts to actually know what it is.

Finally, again I ask what are we supposed to do if not economically incentivise Brazil to do the right thing? I don't think it's reasonable to use military force and while culture is referenced as a source of power, I don't think a diss track is going to convince Brazil to change their actions."

That's a hard pill to swallow for a nation that has long been built on exceptionalism. Imagine how horribly the US would take it if they suddenly stopped being globally relevant and people considered Canada the real power on the continent. 

This level of exceptionalism is of course directly tied to nationalism and the two of course are not going to admit that the nation just isn't a global power anymore. Then you need a reason why they currently aren't a global power. Of course, nationalism means that you cannot blame anything about the nation itself for it, so you have to look outside. That's where the EU comes in.

Then you have the issue of momentum. It's great to tell your constituents that it's outside forces and not them that are to blame, and it is great to stoke their fervor, but what do you do when your actions that were mostly made to garner support start to culminate? You can't back down, that's out of the question, so you just hope the fervor isn't at the level where it'll show all your rhetoric to be the falsities they are."

They sing a song of protecting indigenous land, but that’s just a front. They have no interest in protecting the environment. The legislative is predominantly leans left. The left parties in Brazil are the personification of corruption. Since the end of military dictatorship, Brazil has had one president impeached and removed from office, one president that resigned to avoid impeachment, and a former president that was was convicted after he left office. To overcompensate the atrocities of the military dictatorship, Brazil has historically been a center left leaning country. However, extreme corruption has led Brazil to once again over compensate by electing a moron who refuses to accept science, right leaning asshat. Soccer and carnaval used to be Brazil’s figurative religions. Now politics has, like in the US, become a matter of faith too. People vote with their guts, not their heads, and their supported politician can do no wrong. For instance, the politician who broke ties with Bolsonaro after the military police scandal and who had a vital vote that helped impeach the former left wing president from the PT party, has been accused by Bolsonaro supporters of being a PT spy infiltrated into Bolsonaro’s cabinet in order to destroy Bolsonaro from within. It’s batshit crazy over there. More so than here in the US.

The real concern is often not online attacks and yes, these systems can prevent hundreds to millions of guesses needed to break in. But ultimately you need layered security, so that should include good passwords. My argument that this wouldn't have sufficient entropy still stands.

For example even in the case of WPA2 which was once reasonably secure my buddy is now cracking these with only a single sample to brute force. This wasn't intended possible in the protocol but eventually was.

This has other big impacts too like if a database with authentication information is leaked. People will grab the salted and or hashed passwords and user accounts and crack the hash, then start trying to authenticate with those credentials everywhere.

You acknowledge that this brute force hashing isn't applicable to a lot of systems with bottlenecks for auth attempts but still, a password being that insecure will have effects down the line if there's a protocol or implementation mistake. This is why you wouldn't want to use an eight digit PIN for accessing your bank, but that would be fundamentally safe if the login attempts are limited. Until of course it's not."

With how central charity and justice for the poor and wretched is to the New Testament no Christian should support a system that flies in the face of those values.
