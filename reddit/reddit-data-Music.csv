Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

1601862960.0|Music|famousninja|"Mad? More bemused at how people buy into the notion of having to actually do something, but rather than doing work they just hit a like button and get the satisfaction of ""doing something"".

The problem is that it's not substantial, and it's not long before the ""have to do something"" notion comes back.

In any act, the live style can usually be much different than the studio. With progressive bands, they usually have a focus on improv. With punk, it’s more about the energy than anything which is why some prefer it."

I like this song, I think it captures that sobering look back we do sometimes on what was a painful break-up at the time.

Torquil's part reminds me of an ex-girlfriend, of being with her 30 years ago, in the back of a friend's car, not a taxi, when it was snowing, not raining and it was the Victoria Bridge, not the Champlain Bridge :D"

> Sly & the Family Stone were an important and influential band from Vallejo, California, United States. Active from 1966 until 1975, the band was pivotal in the development of soul, funk and psychedelia. Headed by singer, songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist Sly Stone, and containing several of his family members and friends, the band was the first major American rock band to have an integrated lineup in both race and gender.

> Brothers Sly Stone and singer/guitarist Freddie Stone combined their bands (Sly & the Stoners and Freddie & the Stone Souls) at the end of 1966. Sly and Freddie Stone, trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, drummer Gregg Errico, saxophonist Jerry Martini, and bassist Larry Graham completed the original lineup; Sly and Freddie's sister, singer/keyboardist Rose Stone, joined within a year. This collective recorded five Top 10 hits and four groundbreaking albums, which greatly influenced the sound of American pop music, soul, R&B, funk, and hip hop music. In the preface of his 1998 book For the Record: Sly and the Family Stone: An Oral History, Joel Selvin sums up the importance of Sly & the Family Stone's influence on African American music by stating ""there are two types of black music: black music before Sly Stone, and black music after Sly Stone"". The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.
During the early 1970s, the band switched to a grittier funk sound, which was as influential on the music industry as their earlier work. The band began to fall apart during this period because of drug abuse and ego clashes; consequently, the fortunes and reliability of the band deteriorated, leading to its dissolution in 1975. Sly Stone continued to record albums and tour with a new rotating lineup under the ""Sly & the Family Stone"" name from 1975 to 1983. In 1987, Sly Stone was arrested and sentenced for cocaine use, after which he went into effective retirement.

1601856888.0|Music|AutoModerator|"No /r/ifyoulikeblank, /r/tipofmytongue, and request style posts. Posts asking for music recommendations based on an artist or other personal taste are not allowed. These belong in /r/ifyoulikeblank or /r/recordstore, active communities that specialize in making recommendations. Similarly, posts that ask for help identifying a song (whether it's the name of the track or a link to it) are not permitted. You may direct these kinds of posts to /r/tipofmytongue and /r/namethatsong. Generally, any request seeking a sole (or limited) identifiable answer(s) is subject to removal. These submissions fail to meet our text post standards, which focus on generating discussion.

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

 [artist pic](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/252/2a96cbd8b46e442fc41c2b86b821562f.png)  

> Authority Zero is a punk rock band from Mesa, Arizona . Authority Zero was started in 1994. The band has punk rock and reggae influences, with Bad Religion, Pennywise, and Sublime as heavy influences for the band. There is also an obvious Spanish/Portuguese influence in the band's music. 

> The band's latest album, entitled The Tipping Point was released on April 2nd 2013. The band toured with Rehab on the ""Lack of Luxury"" 2007 tour. This album is the final one featuring Jeremy Wood on bass, leaving in November 2006 due to personal differences within the band.

> Lead singer Jason DeVore has also released material as a solo artist.

> Authority Zero was started in 1994 when Bill Marcks met Jason DeVore at Westwood High School. Marcks didn't actually meet DeVore until the summer of 1995, until then Authority Zero consisted of two guitarists (Marcks & Jerry Douglas) and a drummer J.W. Gordon, all from Westwood. This trio put a few songs together without lyrics or basslines. When that summer rolled around, Douglas was expecting the yearly visit of his friend Jason DeVore, from Wyoming. Douglas introduced his long time friend and Marcks jokingly asked if he wanted to be their singer, soon later it was no joke.

> Marcks was impressed with DeVore's ability to ""write catchy songs in fifteen minutes with really sticky hooks"". The two quickly enlisted Jeremy Wood on bass. His experience with lead guitar and musical theory separated his bass playing from others'. Not just a ""follow along,"" his baselines were independent and yet fluid with the music. (Wood actually taught Marcks & Douglas how to play guitar). However, because of Gordon's commitment to the Air Force, his position as drummer soon had to be replaced. Fellow classmate, skateboarder, and drummer Daniel Garcia fit this empty stool like a missing puzzle piece. He brought a new charge and tempo that evolved Authority Zero's music into a faster, more complex, punk rock style. Eventually, however, differences and family obligations led to Garcia's exit from the group.

> Marcks, Douglas, DeVore, and Wood finally came upon Los Angeles native Jim Wilcox formerly of Welter/The New Militia who's tragic events ended the group, and he fittingly completed the Authority Zero's lineup. Later Douglas also left the group and joined the Air Force.

> After releasing a local EP that sold very well, Authority Zero released their debut album A Passage In Time in 2002 on Lava Records. The album featured a blend of genres including punk rock and reggae, with obvious Spanish and Portuguese influences. A Passage In Time included the hits ""One More Minute"" and ""Over Seasons"".

> The success of A Passage In Time propelled the band into new popularity. Authority Zero appeared on many tours, such as Warped Tour, the No Use for a Name/The Starting Line tour, and Sum 41's ""Sum on Your Face"". The band has also toured with the likes of Everclear, Guttermouth and H2O.

> In 2004, Authority Zero released Andiamó, again on Lava Records. ""Andiamó"" means literally ""We go"" in Italian, but can also be read as ""And I am Zero"", the title of their live DVD released following Andiamó. The album again featured a blend of genres and Spanish/Portuguese influences. Andiamó is somewhat politically charged, evident in the songs ""Revolution"", ""A Thousand Years of War"", and the cover of the song ""Mexican Radio"", originally written by Wall of Voodoo (the version that appears on Andiamó has lyric changes in order to make a statement against the 2003 invasion of Iraq). In the summer of 2006, Authority Zero released a live acoustic compilation album titled Rhythm and Booze on Suburban Noize Records.

> The band's next album, entitled 12:34 was released on January 30, 2007. The track ""Courage"" was released as a single. The band recently toured with Rehab on the ""Lack of Luxury"" 2007 tour. This album is the final one featuring Jeremy Wood on bass, who left Authority Zero in November 2006 due to personal differences within the band.

> On December 30th, 2008 Bill Marcks posted a blog on his MySpace stating he left the band to spend more time with his family and to focus 100 percent on his new band, Sanziggo.

> Jason DeVore has also been working on a side project called The Bollox, an Irish punk band he started with longtime friends.

> It has also been confirmed that Authority Zero is working on a new studio album to be released February of 2010.

> Dean ""DJ"" Farmer resigned as the bass player on July 20, 2009 citing personal, business, and creative differences.

> Jeremy Wood has rejoined Authority Zero as the bass player.

1601853334.0|Music|caligari87|"Honestly it wasn't typically meant to be ""enjoyed"" at least not in the conventional sense.

Punk back then was about rebellion, non-conformity, breaking down of power structures, etc. Often that included rejecting things like traditional musical structure and sounds. It's meant to be abrasive, rough, nasty, and hard to like. It's meant to shock, to make proper society gasp in horror at this monstrous affront to ""good taste"". Plus the fact that a lot of punk musicians didn't actually have much in the way of musical training or ability; a common trope was that ""all you need is three chords and the truth"".

Nowadays, ""punk"" as a genre has been mostly co-opted by commercial interests. Packaged and polished in a more accessible format, just edgy enough to be exciting but not so abrasive that it can't sell millions of albums with a catchy radio single. 

The counterculture, ironically, became the culture."

He found them again years later and upon this rediscovery, he has gained new insights that allow him to appreciate the album on a deeper level than he previously could. Just like some similar music in the Post/Prog-rock world, it took him some time to truly appreciate the album. He attempts to elaborate more but he knows that what he gets out of it isn't going to be the same as another listener. He enjoyed the ups and downs, through the oppressive melancholy and to the minuscule glimmer of hope hidden within. The album clearly means a lot to OP and he felt the need to share his emotions relating to it. Not too sure what wasn't clear in what he said but I hope I managed to clear it up for you. Godspeed You! Black Emperor.

1601848690.0|Music|v1sualart|"Cambodia wasn't communism. Holiday in Cambodia isn't a critique of communism. It was a critique of ""ally"" liberals who acted like they were helping the poor by talking about their problems (think Buttigieg's medicare ""for all who want it""). It was a critique of being fake woke. 

What happened with the Khmer Rouge was CIA-backed authoritarianism that was then used as propaganda to have further demonize communism and to prevent China & Vietnam from controlling all of Indochina. 

""The U.S. permitted Thailand to allow the Khmer Rouge to use bases in Thailand to wage a war of insurrection against the government in Phnom Penh that had been installed by Vietnam. Elizabeth Becker reported that U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski claimed that he ""concocted the idea of persuading Thailand to cooperate fully in efforts to rebuild the Khmer Rouge.""

It does not get mentioned much, but Vietnam removed Pol Pot from power."

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback

* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

1601846888.0|Music|re10pect|"Mechanical Bull is worth the listen, it still have 6-7 good rock songs on there, with Tonight, Temple, Wait for Me and Rock City being the best to me. 

Walls was admittedly a big letdown for me.  Reverend, Find Me, and Conversation Piece are really the only songs on there that got many repeat listens out of me. 

That being said I’m still excited to see what they release next. It’s unrealistic to expect a bands sound not to change after making it as big as they did. I hope they strip back the production a bit and just make a decent rock album."

I still loved the album this song came from and thought Come around Sundown had very good songs on it even if it was way overproduced.

These belong in /r/ifyoulikeblank or /r/recordstore, active communities that specialize in making recommendations.

You may direct these kinds of posts to /r/tipofmytongue and /r/namethatsong. Generally, any request seeking a sole (or limited) identifiable answer(s) is subject to removal.

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

There are so many good drummers out there across all the genres, that it'd be really hard to decide for me. Travis does have that super solid background of drum corps behind him, but I've always been more preferential to a drumming style that is more free-form in nature. I definitely feel that Blink did get quite a bit better with Travis coming in after Chesire and Dude Ranch, though. That's for sure.

And, tbh, I started to kind of stray away from *Strung Out* after Blackhawks, so I haven't really listened to their newer stuff all that much. But I have seen some videos of Shankle playing some of their older stuff, and he really does do a good job emulating Jordan's playing style. You can tell he's in touch with that more metal side of *Strung Out*. Which is cool.

1601844087.0|Music|HurricaneDane|"Wow! That is strikingly similar.

I was going to comment on [sampling other artists](https://youtu.be/v89CjsSOJ_c), but this seems like a different case. There's the possibility that they're using that riff with permission, although that seems unlikely. 
Could there be a crossover between musicians from both bands? I did a quick google search but didn't find much.

While it's likely that it was a blatant ripoff, it's also possible that someone heard it, liked it and forgot about it, and then pulled it out later during songwriting.  
Check out Jorge Ben Jor's [*Taj Mahal*](https://youtu.be/rfrpOhC6858) (1972).  
Sound familiar?  
Here's Rod Stewart's [*Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?](https://youtu.be/Hphwfq1wLJs) (1978).

This happens all the time in the music industry. Sometimes it's ok, sometimes people get sued. It's possible that this case has already been addressed and closed. 

It looks like Cody Fry has both [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/codyfry?lang=en) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/codyfry/?hl=en) accounts, you could try to reach out to him on one of those and see if there's more to the story."

Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Anti-Flag, nofx, greenday heck even offspring all got into the political scene mostly because of Bush. Now we have a much more crazy leader and all these bands are silent. I don't get it?

1601838196.0|Music|odst94|"I think there's a common misconception that equates punk bands to anarchy just because they sing against governments. These bands are against our applications of government, not the concept of government itself.

>Why didn't anyone make a song telling them to go out and vote?

Fat Mike kick-started punkvoter.org specifically to register kids to vote in 04. This was when both of the Rock Against Bush compilations and tour raised $1 million for John Kerry. Franco un-American is specifically about how Fat Mike finally cares about politics and not nihilism or anarchism. Anarchy Camp exists, but NoFX have always had songs of fantasy: Pharmacist's Daughter, Mattersville, S&M Airlines, the Man I Killed.

Neither Anti-Flag nor Bad Religion or those other bands anarchist. They're both very progressive and their views align with Bernie Sanders, an opponent to anarchism. Robin Hood in Reverse and the Economy is Suffering... Let it Die are calls for progressivism, government assistance towards the working class and poor.

""Here's the church, there's the steeple, open up the doors corporations are people, wait what did he say? What the fuck did he say?""

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Frank Sinatra - personally I liked his acting better, still a great crooner

1601836017.0|Music|Procrastinatron|"Man, everything's so fucking complicated. I can't decide whether or not I should care where my music comes from. I mean, on the one hand the comment you're talking about makes me cringe, because I am at my core a democratic socialist. Then I read the article linked below, and I see Buzzo's point (although the Nazi comment still irks me). Then I start wondering if I'm supposed to do research on every single thing that I consume. Because, I mean, on a certain level it sort of makes sense that I should, because I do want to be at least a *somewhat* ethical person. But given how complex and just outright complicated the world is now, that seems like a one-way street to becoming a pathologically fussy, neurotic mess that is so bothered by the potential consequences of my every decision that I just get stuck in a state of perpetual indecision and ethical inadequacy.

...And all I wanted was to listen to some fucking music."

> Cassandra Wilson (born 4th December 1955) is a U.S. jazz vocalist and two-time Grammy Award winner from Jackson, Mississippi. Two of her albums, Blue Skies (1988) and New Moon Daughter (1996), have topped the US jazz charts, and the latter also won her a Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Performance in 1997. More recently, Wilson's album Loverly (2008) also won the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album at the 51st Grammy Awards in 2009.

> Wilson's repertoire includes both jazz and blues standards and renditions of pop and rock songs. Her contralto voice has been described as bluesy and sultry, and the style of her music ranges from swing to funk to bossa nova. Many of the songs she covers are by artists who usually record in other genres.

> Wilson counts the late Miles Davis as one of her greatest influences. In 1989 she performed as the opening act for Davis at the JVC Jazz Festival in Chicago. In 1999 she produced Traveling Miles as a tribute to Davis. The album developed from a series of jazz concerts that she performed at Lincoln Center in November 1997 in Davis's honor and includes three selections based on Davis's own compositions, in which Wilson adapted the original themes.

We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

1601834207.0|Music|GloriousHam|"> the album hadn’t dropped yet

The Decline had been out for years for the show I was at. They had never played it live in it's entirety until the night before in Toronto. Over the years they had played bits and pieces, but never the whole song. 

Not sure why nobody knew what they were doing for 18 minutes unless nobody at that Toronto show knew who the fuck NOFX was."

1601834077.0|Music|GloriousHam|"I honestly have no idea. That sounds very familiar, but itt was like 16+ years ago and I was fucked up the entire time I was there. 

What I do remember was that my friend and I got in because some random girl and her friend literally GAVE us their tickets because they weren't going to have an issue getting in without them. We were desperate to get in and no one was selling tickets outside. Both my friend and I are still somewhat in touch with that girl to this day.

I also met Nubs. I remember that too."

1601832872.0|Music|TheCheechWizardUnit|Yes a cliche but totally awesome! That's why it's a cliche! It is a great song because it basically has all the chords you will *almost* ever need while playing the uke. If you want a beginner's too for that song only play the C, G, Am, Em and F...skip the other chords for now and maybe forever. Lol  Now go find a YouTuber that teaches it! Have fun!
1601832857.0|Music|AutoModerator|"No /r/ifyoulikeblank, /r/tipofmytongue, and request style posts. Posts asking for music recommendations based on an artist or other personal taste are not allowed. These belong in /r/ifyoulikeblank or /r/recordstore, active communities that specialize in making recommendations. Similarly, posts that ask for help identifying a song (whether it's the name of the track or a link to it) are not permitted. You may direct these kinds of posts to /r/tipofmytongue and /r/namethatsong. Generally, any request seeking a sole (or limited) identifiable answer(s) is subject to removal. These submissions fail to meet our text post standards, which focus on generating discussion.

1601831931.0|Music|MrSpindles|Well, once we can all come out of our boxes again they are a solid live act that tour all the time, so you never know your luck, they might be passing by somewhere near you one day.  The events industry is in crisis, so I for one am keen to get back out there as soon as I can, support people whose jobs have collapsed and enjoy live music again.
1601831892.0|Music|callmesixone|The Devil Makes Three does a great version of this song
1601831802.0|Music|juandiegoaj|Yeah, I want to learn and take it everywhere, very portable! Do you got any tips as a beginner?
1601831781.0|Music|LanceFree|Hi-dee hi-dee hi-dee hi,
1601831770.0|Music|j1lted|"can't edit titles, otherwise ""Local man saves kitten"" becomes ""Hitler did nothing wrong"""
1601831726.0|Music|phatelectribe|"Great version although I still prefer the original. However, Heartbeats (especially the live version) is one of the greatest performances I’ve ever heard.

1601831674.0|Music|helchez|Fat Mike sucks live. The rest of the band is usually pretty good. Fat Mike is either high or drunk most of the time and can't remember songs. He has gotten a little better, but has more bad shows than good ones.
1601831661.0|Music|BaconCheeseVegan43|Violins was my anthem for too many years.
1601831657.0|Music|xonjas|So lucky! I'd love to get a chance to see them live.

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash "" - "", and does it have the [genre]?

1601831533.0|Music|TheCheechWizardUnit|NP. Yes, I agree it's a healthy hobby! I picked it up after learning to play the guitar basics. The uke is so much easier to learn but it helps if you're a good singer.. which I'm not.  The uke is also very portable so you can take it almost anywhere without difficulty to practice or jam with friends.
1601831475.0|Music|sporkism|This song always reminds me of being 15 years old. My mind was completely blown at the time. To this day I get an overwhelming mix of nostalgia and sadness whenever I hear it. Can't believe so many years have gone by, and the world still feels as ugly and hopeless as ever.
1601831462.0|Music|Blink_Billy|They were completely right. Fuck off
