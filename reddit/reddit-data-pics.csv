1601865947.0|pics|Harambe-2036|">""Funny, but it is not a fucking pic."" - keynote0

keynote0 is claiming that while the image is funny it does not belong on this subreddit because it's not a picture (""pic"" is short for the word ""picture"").

>""Um, yes it is?"" - Rivent

Rivent is claiming that it is a picture. Further implication is that it does belong on this subreddit.

>""It's an image not a picture."" - Me

I am making the argument that ""picture"" in the context of this subreddit is something that has been taken by a camera and is largely unedited. This is a photoshopped joke/image and not really appropriate for this subreddit. It belongs in /r/funny or /r/politicalhumor. Furthermore, I would argue that this violates at least the spirit of Rule 1B, even though there is no text. 

/u/PFnewguy...is this slow enough for you?"

1601865945.0|pics|Atomhed|"The literal definition of conservatism:  

Noun 

1. Commitment to traditional values and ideas with opposition to change or innovation.  

2. The holding of political views that favor free enterprise, private ownership, and socially conservative ideas.  

>Conservatives merely dont believe in tearing down the past and institutions.

You can't tear down the past, it's the past, it's being replaced with the future whether conservatives like it or not - and any institution that causes problems in society should be replaced as well, there is no reason to ""believe"" in institutions that don't serve the people who fund them."

Considering Vice has never been a right-wing rag, I think its safe to say the other founders were not similar to Mcinnes.  If Hitler had founded a mag with 2 other people and nary a word about the Jews being the death of Germany, its safe to say Hitler was irrelevant in editorial content.  You're trying to argue that the principle founder and leader of a political activist group who recruits his own members is immaterial to the group's actions, statements, and presence in the political sphere.  I don't know how much more dense that can get.

The organizers, the proud boys members who have been initiated, carry the confederate flag.  Shit, the proud boys have more strict organization than BLM does, it isn't some rag tag right wing equivalent of Antifa.  They even have uniforms for fuck's sake.

Smell supposedly is the sense with the strongest memory. One time when I was on the UofM twin cities campus and had to use the bathroom I went to the basement of Kolthoff Hall to use that one. The soap in the dispenser was the same smell of the soap that I had in kindergarten. And that realization happened instantly. I don't remember a ton of things from childhood so this lightning strike was insane. That was the only bathroom that I ever found on campus that had that soap."

1601865292.0|pics|jlharper|"To anyone who is looking for a window into how these hate-based white supremacist groups manage to recruit new members, this is all you need to see. Notice the rebranding of 'hating others' as 'West is Best'. Rather than 'Right to incite hatred and commit assault on minorities' they say 'anti political correctness'. Notice how they want to put women back in the kitchen, but they frame it as 'venerating the housewife'.

Through careful marketing and manipulation of reality (literal fake news) they are able to hide their hate and bigotry behind a thin curtain of a 'pro male' agenda. They do not 'support men'. They ***do no***t donate to men's rights organizations or try to endorse pro-male legislation, or help to educate young men to help them achieve more in their life.

What they do is verbally, mentally and physically attack those who do not fit their narrow definition of the ideal man, which is a white, western male. That is because they are a hate group who is pro white male and anti everyone else.

It is likely this person is a member of the proud boys but distances himself from the group while sharing their recruitment message, portraying himself as a neutral third party rather than a recruiter to seem unbiased. It is an age old tactic. He will also be a racist, a white supremacist, a republican party conservative and a Trump supporter, but would potentially even deny all of the above when called out as such."

1601865049.0|pics|Nemonius|"Yeah we need the people to unite and create an order of social capitalism. 

The current dynamic, where we have ghouls who earn their living a hundred times over, not by working, but by owning land, or buildings or even the equipment and patents that you need in order to do your job, is fundamentally broken.

These ghouls have eroded democracy through donations, lobbying and joboffers to politiciand.

The new era of social capitalism MUST be one that seeks to abolish this separation of society into owners and producers. We, the producers, are the many, and if we all start seeing the oppression that this separation puts on us and join forces, they can never defeat us.

There is a spectre haunting America, the spectre of social capitalism."

1601864954.0|pics|BobTheCircleGuy|"I’m 16 haha.

Idk I guess I just have an old spirit in me.


to be honest I’ll try not to be rude about it and just give my opinion, I just don’t find them too useful, and the symptoms I’ve seen of COVID just seem so similar to the Flu.

We don’t wear masks for the flu, why this, why didn’t we do this for Ebola or swine flu?

And sure, 200k people died, that is a lot, but the flu kills millions of people a year anyway, but that gets no recognition because it’s common.

Idk, I just don’t really think we should be so worried about corona because it’s just something, in my opinion, similar to the Flu, with very similar symptoms, maybe a few different but nothing life threatening.

Take it like this, my grandfather is 78, if he got the flu, he would have a small chance at dying, and it’s pretty much the exact same for corona, since someone on the Wall Street journal said that trump, who is in his 70’s, and is overweight, has a 4% chance of death, which isn’t that bad for how old he is and his health at the moment"

1601864951.0|pics|Time_Vault|I'd argue that nationalism is inherently a bad thing, just like any other type of hubris. That's not to say having some patriotism is inherently bad, but nationalism generally leads to people covering their eyes and ears whenever their country is criticized. And just from what I've seen of the proud boys, they are often closer to the latter than the former.

There are few suspicious things as well.  Lack of tweets, application of a treatment reserved for more severe cases, staged PR stunts (why stage a couple of fleeting stunts when they could just accurately report he’s doing well?  He could give interviews all day long and tweet clips if he was actually doing so well.  Instead they’ve put forward a couple of these moments?)."

1601864815.0|pics|Mrrasta1|Got a story for you. Boeing and paint. My uncle was a master painter at Boeing for years and years when his supervisor came to him with a number one priority job. He needed three cruise missiles for Monday to show off to some Washington big shots. Senators and Pentagon dudes. He said point blank it wasn’t possible. The super said whatever it takes, get it done. OK uncle gets three shifts a day organized and away they go. It’s Friday and they have two and a half days to get the missiles ready. The paint has to be perfect. A couple of millimeters thickness on one side or the other can affect performance, but everybody pulled together with their best effort. Monday rolls around and the cruise missiles are waiting to be launched for the big shots. The first one looks good but starts to roll pretty bad so they blow it up. Number two is picture perfect. Number three starts to corkscrew wildly right after launch and has to be destoyed. Everyone shakes hands, job well done blah blah, and they head back to Washington. No one said a thing about it to my uncle or his crew.

The problem with drones is that the fatalities were something like 90% civilians. I'm also not sure they're productive. Raining death from the sky tends to radicalize people who otherwise may not have been. 

Semi-related is the phenomenon of drone operators having PTSD from grappling with the detached nature of killing people from thousands of miles away.

When we told some family about the pregnancy they flipped out asking whose egg was used and how blood relatives have a right to know that they have a new family member. Then they spouted off a list of all these people who I haven’t spoken to in 10 years that I *need* to tell. 

My closest family is by marriage, not by blood.  They then offered ‘congratulations’ by just saying ‘well we hope for a healthy baby’.  

The mention of blood relatives just felt like a way to dismiss the baby if it was my wife’s egg."

Blaming him directly is a bit ridiculous, sure. But to say anything less than ""His policies and party handled this about as poorly as possible"" is a joke. He, and his demonization of science are to blame. He is the president. The leader of this nation.

1601864310.0|pics|wil318466|"I don't deny reality in the least bit, you simply don't understand how the world works and what is true or not.  It's blatantly obvious YOU are the one believing what you're told, not me.  I don't care what Trump says, I look at the actual data.  You think I blindly believe what any person in this world tells me without looking it up myself?  Only a fool does that. 

Firstly, you believe that all the data you are given is true by default, and that it can not possibly be incorrect or manipulated.  Secondly, you're talking in absolute numbers and not percentages, because the populations of the countries you are talking about are wildly different, which even a child would realize.  Thirdly, you are the one using the argument from authority, with your ""trust in the science"" bullshit, which is OBVIOUSLY wrong. 

Lets look at a few things logically here.  Why do you think deaths in the US were being reported in the begining then all of a sudden it was switched to infections?  Why did Sweden, which had no lockdown whatsoever, have a similar death/infection rate as countries that had total lockdowns?  Also, what is the actual survival rate of the virus, in each age category?

YOU are the one blindly believing what you're being told by people who have absolutely no clue what they are talking about.  YOU are the one who believes propaganda, who completely disregards people who disagree with you as being fanboys. 

I look at everything through a skeptical eye.  I don't believe a fucking thing unless Iook it up myself, and I've come to the conclusion that almost every story about this is completely backwards.

Believe what you want, it's your life.  But I think one day soon you'll realize that the stuff you believe in is absolutely wrong.

Have fun."

They are both part of what makes a person's identity -- nature and nurture combine to make us who we are. If someone has an awesome stepparent, they still may have information they want to find out from a biological parent such as health info, ethnicity, family history etc that a step parent simply can't provide them. Either way, the person that raises you and loves you will always be most important.

When did I ever say anything of the sort?

You're reading a lot into what I've said that just isn't there. Take a step back an reassess the situation.

Trump is a vile piece of shit that has disgraced this planet with his presence, Biden would 100% be better. That doesn't mean we should disregard his flaws and the fact that he does not want to do what's best for Americans."

1601864147.0|pics|evangelion-unit-two|Sure we do. Pointing to the *even worse* things Trump does is just a very concise way of pointing out that the people criticizing Obama generally care more about partisanship than the issues they're actually criticizing. I would argue that the use of drone strikes overall isn't a terrible strategy. If you're committed to continuing to combat ISIS and not completely pulling out of the middle east (read: power vacuum), then you can either send in troops, convince regional powers to send in troops, or use drones. The first gets American soldiers killed, the second is politically complicated and probably not practical to make a reality, so why not go with drones?

Noun  

1. Commitment to traditional values and ideas with opposition to change or innovation.

2. The holding of political views that favor free enterprise, private ownership, and socially conservative ideas.

>Conservatism is merely against radical reform...its not regressivism. Building on the past more than starting from.scratch.

Conservatives will call the solution to any problem ""radical reform"" if it causes them to lose a single cent o or bear even the mildest inconvenience.

The simple fact of the matter is that the problems we face today have no solution in the past that birthed these problems.

The red states that locked down the way they did, they were trying to not destroy their economies, and the stimulus was bi partisan. 

The reason they want to ""liberate"" states, is because their economies have grinded to a halt and they're going to see worse results from the continuous lock downs. Also, PA's lock downs were recently ruled unconstitutional.

So, Trump isn't far right, nor has he pushed the party to the right. If he was far right he wouldn't have went with the bump stock ban, the stimulus package, or increase our deficit."

1601863548.0|pics|AutoModerator|"[Obviously all lives matter. No one said they didn't](https://i.imgur.com/UyCmhSx.png). However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

The GOP would have to nominate someone else, but with so little time to get their name on the ballot and so many votes already cast, it becuase almost impossible for Biden to lose. Trump's votes don't transfer to their new candidate. 

So Biden would basically win by default. With Trump dead the likelihood that his base would turn out for down ballot elections would probably go down I think. Resulting an incredibly large blue was across local, state and federal elections.

Though he did seem to narrow the scope of it. For those curious:

>Trump on Wednesday revoked Section 3 of Executive Order 13732, which required the director of national intelligence or other official to obtain information on the number of U.S. strikes against terrorist targets outside active combat zones.

>That order, which was signed by President Obama July 1, 2016, also required assessments of combatant and non-combatant deaths from those strikes, as well as the release of an unclassified summary of that information by May 1 of each year.

Although,

>“Including a classified annex allows DoD to share information within the U.S. government, while limiting the ability of enemies to employ counter tactics and procedures to purposefully jeopardize civilian lives as a military tactic,” Tresch said.

1601863352.0|pics|SerRikari|I don't know.  If I was going to make a meme, I'd probably be detailed with it.  Which is probably why I don't make memes.

1601863350.0|pics|TrumpIsPutinsBitch3|">""The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don't kid yourself. When they say they don't care about their lives, you have to take out their families,"" Trump said.


Only 90? Those are terrible numbers, that's why Trump's policy is 100%."
1601863349.0|pics|EmperorOfNipples|"From a purely US perspective indeed. But from an international perspective it is annoying to see words like Liberal and Conservative become caracatures of what they used to be....and over the ocean what they still are.

Over here a social Liberal can be a Conservative and there is no conflict....Liberalism in its original form."

1601863335.0|pics|montypython112|"Didn't he start travel bans in january? Trump never said it was a hoax, he said dems saying he wasn't doing anything about it was a hoax. Those comments were after the travel ban, which if you'll recall the media said was ""racist"""

Holy shit.

1601863315.0|pics|Throranges|I agree, but a lot of religions have broken away from barbarics. But the problem is if you watch the video of a very good discussion, it's like 5 minutes. Islam still can't fully reject the barbarics.

So, why are you making shit up? Since when is signing blank pieces of paper protocol?  

I'm not sure why you believe that a staged photoshoot with fake documents is appropriate, but even full fledged autocrats are mocked for those sorts of lies, including Putin and Kim Jong Un."

1601863305.0|pics|theobviouschilde|This is true, perhaps, but it’s also sort of a privileged comment. For example- As someone also not in this situation, I’ve so easily taken for granted the “family history” questions at the doctors office. I’ve never had to wonder what health issues reside within my genetic lineage because I personally know this lineage. Genetics are one of the leading determinants of a persons health/well-being (alongside our social bonds) and understanding pieces of ones genetic history is important for some people, regardless of our other important bonds.
1601863301.0|pics|phenopsyche|"You misunderstand what civilized is and most likely equate it with manners, that's a different word. Also your analogy doesn't fit as the man isn't attempting to elicit a change in behavior  from the person he is disrespecting, say like a letter to the mayor, simply expressing disapproval and disrespect. Lastly you  seem under the idea that respect is something that can't be lost after acts one considers unforgivable. 
Its seems odd that you believe those that take their freedom for granted shouldn't use it."
1601863299.0|pics|Semi_HadrOn|I’ve tried but I’m unable to come up with anything as pathetic as that.
1601863295.0|pics|JohnTheMod|Someone tried to defend the blank pages by saying he was signing top secret documents and they had him sign a blank page so the contents wouldn’t get out.  I wish I had a decent answer for him.
1601863295.0|pics|ZeboSecurity|It may surprise you to learn that most civilized countries have freedom of speech.
1601863287.0|pics|SHOCKLTco|And the fact they were kinda sucking up to Putin was a bit of a red flag as well, given the current administrations relationship with both fox news and Russia.

1601863269.0|pics|montypython112|None of what you said is true. The white house doesn't have full time doctors ofmultiple specialites, doesn't have near the same medical facilities as walter reed. His docs made it clear he went as a precaution, and we know when you get covid if it's gonna go poorly, it does so later on, not days two or three. Also also, the dude walked to the helicopter to walter reed. Stop spreading reactionary bull.

And stand a chance at the election?  I hate to break it to you, but in even the most conservative polls it shows 81 times out of 100 scenarios of the election Biden wins.
