1601865049.0|pics|Nemonius|"Yeah we need the people to unite and create an order of social capitalism. 

This current dynamic where we have ghouls who earn their living a hundred times over, not by working, but by owning land, or buildings or even the equipment and patents that you need in order to do your job.

These ghouls have eroded democracy through donations, lobbying and joboffers to politiciand.

The new era of social capitalism MUST be one that seeks to abolish this separation of society into owners and producers. We, the producers, are the many, and if we all start seeing the oppression that this separation puts on us and join forces, they can never defeat us.

There is a spectre haunting America, the spectre of social capitalism."

1601864954.0|pics|BobTheCircleGuy|"I‚Äôm 16 haha.

Idk I guess I just have an old spirit in me.


to be honest I‚Äôll try not to be rude about it and just give my opinion, I just don‚Äôt find them too useful, and the symptoms I‚Äôve seen of COVID just seem so similar to the Flu.

We don‚Äôt wear masks for the flu, why this, why didn‚Äôt we do this for Ebola or swine flu?

And sure, 200k people died, that is a lot, but the flu kills millions of people a year anyway, but that gets no recognition because it‚Äôs common.

Idk, I just don‚Äôt really think we should be so worried about corona because it‚Äôs just something, in my opinion, similar to the Flu, with very similar symptoms, maybe a few different but nothing life threatening.

Take it like this, my grandfather is 78, if he got the flu, he would have a small chance at dying, and it‚Äôs pretty much the exact same for corona, since someone on the Wall Street journal said that trump, who is in his 70‚Äôs, and is overweight, has a 4% chance of death, which isn‚Äôt that bad for how old he is and his health at the moment"

1601864951.0|pics|Time_Vault|I'd argue that nationalism is inherently a bad thing, just like any other type of hubris. That's not to say having some patriotism is inherently bad, but nationalism generally leads to people covering their eyes and ears whenever their country is criticized. And just from what I've seen of the proud boys, they are often closer to the latter than the former.

1601864815.0|pics|Mrrasta1|Got a story for you. Boeing and paint. My uncle was a master painter at Boeing for years and years when his supervisor came to him with a number one priority job. He needed three cruise missiles for Monday to show off to some Washington big shots. Senators and Pentagon dudes. He said point blank it wasn‚Äôt possible. The super said whatever it takes, get it done. OK uncle gets three shifts a day organized and away they go. It‚Äôs Friday and they have two and a half days to get the missiles ready. The paint has to be perfect. A couple of millimeters thickness on one side or the other can affect performance, but everybody pulled together with their best effort. Monday rolls around and the cruise missiles are waiting to be launched for the big shots. The first one looks good but starts to roll pretty bad so they blow it up. Number two is picture perfect. Number three starts to corkscrew wildly right after launch and has to be destoyed. Everyone shakes hands, job well done blah blah, and they head back to Washington. No one said a thing about it to my uncle or his crew.

The problem with drones is that the fatalities were something like 90% civilians. I'm also not sure they're productive. Raining death from the sky tends to radicalize people who otherwise may not have been. 

Semi-related is the phenomenon of drone operators having PTSD from grappling with the detached nature of killing people from thousands of miles away.

Then they spouted off a list of all these people who I haven‚Äôt spoken to in 10 years that I *need* to tell. 

My closest family is by marriage, not by blood.  They then offered ‚Äòcongratulations‚Äô by just saying ‚Äòwell we hope for a healthy baby‚Äô.

Blaming him directly is a bit ridiculous, sure. But to say anything less than ""His policies and party handled this about as poorly as possible"" is a joke. He, and his demonization of science are to blame. He is the president. The leader of this nation.

1601864310.0|pics|wil318466|"I don't deny reality in the least bit, you simply don't understand how the world works and what is true or not.  It's blatantly obvious YOU are the one believing what you're told, not me.  I don't care what Trump says, I look at the actual data.  You think I blindly believe what any person in this world tells me without looking it up myself?  Only a fool does that. 

Firstly, you believe that all the data you are given is true by default, and that it can not possibly be incorrect or manipulated.  Secondly, you're talking in absolute numbers and not percentages, because the populations of the countries you are talking about are wildly different, which even a child would realize.  Thirdly, you are the one using the argument from authority, with your ""trust in the science"" bullshit, which is OBVIOUSLY wrong. 

Lets look at a few things logically here.  Why do you think deaths in the US were being reported in the begining then all of a sudden it was switched to infections?  Why did Sweden, which had no lockdown whatsoever, have a similar death/infection rate as countries that had total lockdowns?  Also, what is the actual survival rate of the virus, in each age category?

YOU are the one blindly believing what you're being told by people who have absolutely no clue what they are talking about.  YOU are the one who believes propaganda, who completely disregards people who disagree with you as being fanboys. 

I look at everything through a skeptical eye.  I don't believe a fucking thing unless Iook it up myself, and I've come to the conclusion that almost every story about this is completely backwards.

Believe what you want, it's your life.  But I think one day soon you'll realize that the stuff you believe in is absolutely wrong.

Have fun."

They are both part of what makes a person's identity -- nature and nurture combine to make us who we are. If someone has an awesome stepparent, they still may have information they want to find out from a biological parent such as health info, ethnicity, family history etc that a step parent simply can't provide them. Either way, the person that raises you and loves you will always be most important.

When did I ever say anything of the sort?

You're reading a lot into what I've said that just isn't there. Take a step back an reassess the situation.

Trump is a vile piece of shit that has disgraced this planet with his presence, Biden would 100% be better. That doesn't mean we should disregard his flaws and the fact that he does not want to do what's best for Americans."

1601864147.0|pics|evangelion-unit-two|Sure we do. Pointing to the *even worse* things Trump does is just a very concise way of pointing out that the people criticizing Obama generally care more about partisanship than the issues they're actually criticizing. I would argue that the use of drone strikes overall isn't a terrible strategy. If you're committed to continuing to combat ISIS and not completely pulling out of the middle east (read: power vacuum), then you can either send in troops, convince regional powers to send in troops, or use drones. The first gets American soldiers killed, the second is politically complicated and probably not practical to make a reality, so why not go with drones?

Noun  

1. Commitment to traditional values and ideas with opposition to change or innovation.

2. The holding of political views that favor free enterprise, private ownership, and socially conservative ideas.

>Conservatism is merely against radical reform...its not regressivism. Building on the past more than starting from.scratch.

Conservatives will call the solution to any problem ""radical reform"" if it causes them to lose a single cent o or bear even the mildest inconvenience.

The simple fact of the matter is that the problems we face today have no solution in the past that birthed these problems.

Most of the GOP leadership on the national level did take it seriously in the beginning, especially considering they are in the vulnerable age group. The red states that locked down the way they did, they were trying to not destroy their economies, and the stimulus was bi partisan. 

The reason they want to ""liberate"" states, is because their economies have grinded to a halt and they're going to see worse results from the continuous lock downs. Also, PA's lock downs were recently ruled unconstitutional.

So, Trump isn't far right, nor has he pushed the party to the right. If he was far right he wouldn't have went with the bump stock ban, the stimulus package, or increase our deficit."

1601863548.0|pics|AutoModerator|"[Obviously all lives matter. No one said they didn't](https://i.imgur.com/UyCmhSx.png). However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

The GOP would have to nominate someone else, but with so little time to get their name on the ballot and so many votes already cast, it becuase almost impossible for Biden to lose. Trump's votes don't transfer to their new candidate. 

So Biden would basically win by default. With Trump dead the likelihood that his base would turn out for down ballot elections would probably go down I think. Resulting an incredibly large blue was across local, state and federal elections.

>That order, which was signed by President Obama July 1, 2016, also required assessments of combatant and¬†non-combatant deaths¬†from those strikes, as well as the release of an unclassified summary of that information by May 1 of each year.

Although,

>‚ÄúIncluding a classified annex allows DoD to share information within the U.S. government, while limiting the ability of enemies to employ counter tactics and procedures to purposefully jeopardize civilian lives as a military tactic,‚Äù Tresch said.

I just meant to point out that being a Law Professor doesn't exclude you from making boneheaded decisions.

For example, the expansion of executive power under Bush should have been *immediately* rolled back under Obama. It's a major failure for someone who was intimately familiar with constitutional law, how important it is to the balance of powers, and how it could be abused in the wrong hands. Given that, one can assume he made a calculated decision to ignore the constitutional issues so that he could benefit from the same expanded powers."

What I'm disputing is the effectiveness of someone in BC explaining how the prairies are especially racist. For one you failed to prove it, for two even if it was true, and based off your data it's not, it's a useless blame game."

1601862989.0|pics|The_Beagle|"Bro stop and think about the things you say. You made a fucking comparison stating that people are unjust in their comparisons between Trump and Obama, regarding drone strikes, because Trump has had more. 

I postulated that the real issue isn‚Äôt that either president used drone strikes, rather the fact that Obama was awarded a Nobel peace prize while maintaining a high degree of drone strikes. Now I hate to be degrading but it is *very* clear that you struggle to connect concepts so I will reiterate: for the *first* time in this thread I associated the fact that Obama won a Nobel peace prize while having a very high amount of drone strikes as being the main reason people took note of his apparent lack of peaceful activity, RATHER than the number itself AND (in case you didn‚Äôt know) Trump has NOT received a Nobel Peace Prize and so less scrutiny has been given to his number of drone strikes BECAUSE it was the hypocrisy of giving a peace prize to a president who bombed the Middle East flat that caught people‚Äôs attention, not the fact that he took action allowed to his office. 

I hope this helps because it can‚Äôt be worded any more clearly, I feel like the potato in my kitchen could grasp this concept, by this point -.-‚Äò have a nice night and great life, I hope you find a good way to enhance your cognitive abilities and critical thinking skills over the course of your life."

That's not the part that's supposed to be funny.

are you saying that if he leave the proud boys, the proud boys are no longer racist?

1601862600.0|pics|grundlesmith|Agreed. I think a realistic solution is to empower independent candidates going forward, even if they never win it would be nice if D+R candidates felt like they had to write policy to compete with a Green New Deal or Economic Bill of Rights. Those two things would do more to combat poverty and inequality than the sum of the gov'ts efforts during my lifetime

 Realistically, just cancel trick or treating and have small family parties. Drive around the neighborhood and look at the decorations. I doubt many people will be passing out candy anyway."
